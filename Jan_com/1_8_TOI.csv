4,['8/01/2020'],It’s never too early to set new year resolutions for your child: Parents,"With competitive parenting being quite the norm these days, it’s not surprising that parents make new year resolutions not just for themselves, but for their children too. While some parents believe that setting goals for children and helping them achieve these goals is a must for the child’s growth and development, others argue that resolutions come from the children themselves when they are ready for it. But where does one draw the line? We talk to parents, children and experts to find out...“Resolutions are made by perceiving the current needs and setting appropriate goals to meet those needs. This requires a certain degree of reasoning, planning, judgement, motivation and values, which are not fully developed till the age of 15 years. It is, therefore, important for parents to step in and introduce the habit of setting goals and work towards achieving them within set deadlines,” explains Dr M Thomas Kishore, additional professor of clinical psychology and consultant clinical psychologist in child and adolescent mental health at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS). “New year resolutions are a great way to get children to set targets for themselves. Making joint resolutions, along with their friends, also helps motivate them to do better together. Using self-affirmative statements, such as ‘I can do it’, ‘I stepped up today’, further help them feel good about sticking to these resolutions, which, in turn, increase self-esteem,” explains Dr Gitanjali Narayanan, associate professor in clinical psychology at NIMHANS.Mental health experts suggest parents ought to be realistic when it comes helping their children set targets. “Set small and tangible goals, which are achievable, and ensure that it interests your child. Identify these goals based on whether they help your child find a sense of purpose and direction. Do not pressurise or restrict your child,” says child mental health specialist, Dr Sujata Shenoy, who adds, “Parents should ensure that their sense of achievement should not collide with their child’s.” “If parents do not exercise caution, they may end up rubbing off their ambitions on their children, especially when it comes to academic achievements. This can put tremendous pressure on children. On the other hand, failure to meet these standards set by parents can lead to low self-esteem among children,” points out Dr M Thomas.Assess your child’s needs andhobbiesHave a positive discussion about goals with your child and arrive at a consensus. This is team workDo not impose a goal on your child, it should be something your child looks forward toResolutions can revolve around positive change in any area, not just academic achievementAppreciate your child for all the efforts he/she puts inAs a parent, one of your own goals need to be about how you have helped your child achieve his/her goalsThere are times when goals cannot be achieved. Encourage your child to have an alternative planFood goals- Eat more greens; reduce snacking between mealsReading goals - Read more books, Set a deadline to finish reading a story bookLifestyle goals - Spend time outdoors and lesser time with gadgets; write more; sleep on time, and for a good eight hoursDeadline goals - Work on finishing what you’ve started",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73138396,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1395131/73138396.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/its-never-too-early-to-set-new-year-resolutions-for-your-child-parents/articleshow/73138396.cms

NEW DELHI: Two days after the mayhem at JNU , Delhi Police has made little headway in investigations. No one has been detained for questioning, or arrested, despite multiple mobile clips and WhatsApp group exchanges that have thrown up the identities and affiliations of several people and point to a conspiracy.Now, police officials say they have failed to get any CCTV footage because the areas where the violence occurred are not covered by cameras. They are scanning footage from main gate cameras, but that may yield little as the goons are unlikely to have entered from there. Cops are also using face recognition software to identify the attackers.Even as the violence was unfolding, cops were filing two FIRs that named JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and others following complaints from JNU about its server room being damaged on Friday and Saturday. No one has been named as accused yet.Under intense media and public glare, the cops have started analysing a list of over 10,000 mobile numbers active in and around Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday. They aim to eliminate students, university staffers, guards and residents of the area in order to identify the 'outsiders' who indulged in violence.Meanwhile, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar took recourse to some wordplay when asked at a press conference who the ""masked men"" who perpetrated the mayhem could be. He said that some students who have been protesting against the fee hike and earlier attacked him had come with ""masked faces"" and damaged the data centre - which appears to be an attempt to blame the Left-affiliated Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU). What the administration is at a loss to explain is why the students' union would attack its own president.Delhi Police on Tuesday issued a public appeal for helping in identifying the suspects. They said: ""A special investigating team (SIT) of the crime branch, headed by DCP Joy Tirkey, is investigating the case. All those who are witnesses to the incident or have information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera are hereby requested to come forward and give their statements/footage/picture in their possession to the SIT at admin block, JNU campus, New Delhi...within seven days."" Contact numbers have also been provided.Earlier in the day, the police served notices on some staffers of the university, asking them to join the investigations. They are questioning wardens and other employees to piece together the actual sequence of events on Sunday. Forensic experts were called in to lift fingerprints and other evidence from the spot. The team visited the hostels to talk to students but found most rooms locked. Statements of some of the injured students have been recorded. The police team has been given a room at the administrative block to conduct the investigations.A senior police officer said that their initial probe has revealed that clashes on the JNU campus took place in four phases - the last two being the most violent - through Sunday. The first clash, according to them, took place near School of Social Sciences and the second near the administrative block at noon. The last two happened at Periyar and Sabarmati hostels in the evening.Another team, led by joint commissioner (western range) Shalini Singh, who is heading a fact-finding committee that is to submit a report to the home ministry, also visited the university on Tuesday and recorded the statements of staffers and the security guards who had been attacked.The police have also questioned Pinky Chaudhary, head of the so-called Hindu Raksha Dal, who has claimed responsibility for the attack on students and teachers. Though no evidence was found against the outfit, police say that they will still be under probe.Meanwhile, Delhi Police have received three more complaints from a professor and two JNU students which are being looked into.In Video: Masked goons with lathis climb over JNU hostel walls, beat up students",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73146587,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206764,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jnu-violence-scant-cctv-footage-no-one-detained-little-headway/articleshow/73146564.cms
8,['8/01/2020'],"Deepika Padukone: When you work with a director like Meghna Gulzar, you surrender","In the midst of a marathon promotional schedule for their film ' Chhapaak ', as director Meghna Gulzar and actor-producer Deepika Padukone sit down to have a chat with us, we ask them if, for a change, they would want to ask each other questions about the film and the journey they have taken together. “We might go on and on, you will have to tell us when to stop!,” says Deepika, as they sportingly kick off the Q/A session. Later, they share with us the common thread that they found in the acid attacks, the confidence and spirit of the survivors who are part of the film, and why it couldn’t have been set anywhere but in Delhi. Excerpts:At no point did I think of it from the vanity point of view. Did I think about my look? Yes, but I was thinking, ‘Wow, I have never done a prosthetic-heavy film before, what would that experience be like for me?’ Do I have to look like Laxmi? Do I have to look like myself if, God forbid, I had to go through something like this? Are we going to find a middle ground? I think those were the kind of technical thoughts, about the execution.Who is the person who is going to execute the prosthetics? Are we going to get someone from India or from outside? But at no point I thought that how is the audience going to think of me or look at me, how is that going to impact my career, my future choice of films – none of those thoughts crossed my mind.I remember the first time we had your costume trial. And there was this wardrobe that had been laid out, which was completely mismatched. And you love to dress up, you are always so immaculately turned out personally also and even in your film, whether you are playing Naina or Piku . Here we had skirts which were of different colours, tops which were of a different colour, the head scarf was mismatched, and for a reason. The space she is in, she is not going to colour-coordinate…I think we got into finer details also like how is that fabric going to feel on Malti’s skin. Having just been through an attack and at what stage of surgery she is at, how is her skin going to react, what would that fabric mean, would it hurt? Would it be soft?I have myself worn clothes from there. All these fancy designer clothes I wear now came much later on in my life. As a model, when I used to come here to Delhi for a lot of fashion shows, I have gone to Janpath myself, I have bought clothes, I have worn them. So I have been familiar with these kind of clothes. That is one part of it, but the other thing is, when you work with Meghna Gulzar or a director like her, you surrender. There are no questions asked. If she has a vision for a character and for a film, you go with it. You may not have that with every director, but I have been very fortunate that in many films I have done, I have been able to blindly trust my director’s vision. So, Meghna, why did I do this film? I keep saying this - because it was your conviction, it was your honesty that you came with for the very first time. I will never forget those moments, I knew I just had to surrender, everything else was done.I'm fortunate to have been able to differentiate the roles. I think there were parts where I was playing both actor and producer, but while filming, I was only the actor. Then when we finished filming, again, more of a producer because you're getting into the marketing part of it. Having said that, I mean, I think at every stage it's been a creative involvement. I have not turned producer for financial reasons. I think for both of us, it came from a very creative space of being more involved and what is best for the film and what is best for this character, also because you were dealing with such a sensitive topic, something that hasn't been showcased in mainstream before.Deepika Padukone as Malti in 'Chhapaak: It was a moment. It was like epiphany. One moment precisely. In 2016, it was that need to generate your own content, because fortunately for me, after a long time, the avenues of being able to make a film easily were opening up. I wanted to never be in a situation where somebody is asking you to make a film but you don’t have the content ready. In that, when I was scoping subjects in news articles, the issue of acid violence stared me from a newspaper, immediately I knew that it was what I want to do.And the day I decided that, the next day I woke up in the morning and the silent desire that I had kept inside me for the previous three years, that that is the face I want to play Malti, I voiced it. I picked up the phone on a common colleague and said set up this meeting (with Deepika) please. And the response that I got saamne se was, ‘Are you sure?’ And I was like, ‘Yes, I am sure’. And two days later, I was at your home.I was not apprehensive. I was um, you know, by now that that's my personality that I, I will not voice out the good things. I will always voice out the stuff that can go wrong. Right? So I was not apprehensive, but it definitely felt like a long shot because this perception is there in the audience, even in filmmakers sometimes, and very wrongly so as I realised now, that actors who are successful and have found, I won’t say ‘comfort zone’ because they like to push the envelope in the different characters they play, but their strengths or their calling cards, they don't like to disinvest themselves off that. They like to keep their armour with them as they go from film to film. That is a perception. And so you think of going to Deepika, who has played queens and is like this, the minute you say beauty, she is almost the first name that will come to you. Right? And so because of that perception, you feel that will she risk it? Would she take this up? It's just that. And that morning, even that hesitation went for a toss.I go with the visual first, because for me, cinema is a visual medium and your sense of sight is what is guiding your entire experience of consuming a film. If I have to take somebody who 60% looks like the character, particularly a real character, then what happens is that the external, fake elements, whether it is the fillers or the prosthetics or hair, that gets diminished. When I'm watching an actor with all that embellishment, it comes in the way for me. So I would not want to do that. I would want to be as close as possible, physically. The exciting part is when you don't have a visual reference, then you just go with a fabulous performer and you create a character. With 'Chhapaak', I've been fortunate that I did a bit of both because, we didn't make Deepika look exactly like Laxmi. You can see a few similarity, visual cues, but it's still Deepika which for me, as a filmmaker and as an audience who would want to go and see her in this role, is extremely gratifying.Meghna Gulzar and Deepika PadukoneOnce I knew what Malti was, I think very organically, very naturally, it had a large part of Laxmi. Also when you're writing, there are parts of you that kind of seep into the characters that you're writing, right? Then the actor comes on board and when you're interacting with the actor, you will go and tweak certain things in the script based on the actor that's going to be playing the part. So with her, if Malti was already spirited, and a little vocal, I made her a little more vocal. That's from my side. 50% of the job the actor does as well. You know, how she has internalised Malti, how she has lived with the character and then it's her interpretation of it as well.Sometimes the process might be slightly more familiar and sometimes you've got to put in a little more effort. With this film I think the biggest preparation for me was the emotional preparation. I'm glad we started that process almost six or eight months before we actually started filming. I needed that time to just internalize it. I needed the time to live with it. So that when I walked onto set, I wasn't acting it, I was feeling it. I think that is really when my journey began. Everything else was external. When you walk onto a film set and you have to play every moment in the life of an acid attack survivor, that's when the journey for me really, really began. And I think that's where it's sort of taken a toll on me emotionally.I don’t think that I could have set the incident anywhere else because if you're doing true life, and if you don’t have authenticity, then you don’t have your audience and your film. Yes, the actual incident happened near Khan Market, near the road where the Metro station is right now. There's no way I could have actually gone there and shot there and locked down that space for three days, morning to night. So you take smaller liberties and go into say a smaller market to recreate. We fictionalise the names. Laxmi is not Laxmi, she is Malti, so you can take small creative, I would not even say liberties, I will say translations. But I couldn't have placed this elsewhere. Also, I don't know whether I should say this, but I genuinely feel this now that I'm seeing the film from a distance, that the Delhi in our film is very un-“film wala Delhi”. It is not the Delhi that you see in films.(cuts in) It is not the Imtiaz wala Delhi. I say this because he is a friend, Imtiaz has a different way of showing Delhi.It was easy. We met at a restaurant for the first time. I had met Laxmi but I was going to meet these girls for the first time. I remember they walked in, I'll never forget their giggles, their spirit. They were ordering things left, right and center. They were firing the person who was bringing the food because he kept bringing the wrong order. This is my memory of them - spirited. I can't define it in any other way. Then of course, each one has a different personality. The one takeaway I had from all four of them was just their confidence and their spirit. It's amazing.I don't think I shied away from anything, in terms of what was crucial to her story being narrated correctly and to do justice to what she had handed to me. I don't think we shied away or omitted anything. Yes, I was very aware that the film needs to have a certain aesthetic level. I was more aware that on this film than on any of my other films. Here we all had a heightened sense of awareness that the aesthetic level of the film needs to be slightly higher because the content is a little, it could be perceived as being difficult to palette.It is also unfamiliar. Unfortunately unfamiliar.Yes, there is. The reason for an attack can be anything. It's not really just unrequited affection or attention. It can even be a rivalry between two families. And because the girl of the family is regarded as this asset in a very strange way. Ki woh jo izzat hoti hai, laaj hoti hai ghar ki, usko tabah kardo. I think more than an act of disfiguring or violence, it was an act of repressing, of smothering. I will press you down, not just physically, I will press you down spiritually, emotionally, internally. It was that. It's actually a play of power.Meghna says that she couldn’t imagine setting 'Chhapaak' anywhere other than DelhiI would really like to hope so. I'll say that replacing acid with another tool of violence may not be that easy because of two things. One, how easily accessible it is and now how horrifically violent it is. Finding a similar tool of violence might be difficult. There is no profile of an acid attacker. Like you have profiles of serial killers, murderers, rapists, molesters because of the variety of reasons why it happens. There is no profile of an acid attack. It actually just takes a moment where an everyday, normal, sabhya person flips. I'm hoping that with this film, once you see the journey, you see the destruction it causes, not just for the person who's been attacked, but for her family, for her environment, for society in general, it may be a little bit of a deterrent, I hope. Having said that, I also feel that it's a lot of responsibility to put on a film.--Sharmila.Bhowmik@timesgroup.com",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73139326,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-447807/73139326.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/deepika-padukone-when-you-work-with-a-director-like-meghna-gulzar-you-surrender/articleshow/73139000.cms
9,['8/01/2020'],"Deepika Padukone: I have a boisterous side, which in all of my so-called elegance, people missed seeing","It’s been an eventful decade for Deepika Padukone . She has had a number of successful films to her credit, made her foray into Hollywood opposite Vin Diesel in ‘xXx: Return of Xander Cage’ (2017) and turned producer. On the personal front, too, she is in a happy space and seems a lot more comfortable revealing her quirky side to the world. The new year has begun on a busy note for the actress with her film, ‘ Chhapaak ’, directed by Meghna Gulzar , set to release in a couple of days. In a chat with BT, she talks about playing Malti, her most emotionally challenging role till date, how she has evolved as a person over the years and why she wants to do a contemporary, light-hearted film with husband Ranveer Singh . Excerpts...This has been my most challenging film, emotionally. There was a lot of preparation before we began shooting — look tests, working on the prosthetics, costumes and readings with co-actors and Meghna. I also spent time with Laxmi (Agarwal, the acid attack survivor, who is the inspiration behind her character). But, for a film of this nature, you can never be fully prepared. How do I prepare myself for that moment when acid is thrown on my face? I can imagine that it happened in a certain way, but I can only live it between ‘action’ and ‘cut’. I have had many of those moments of highs and lows, which took a toll on my mental health as well.I remember on the second day of shoot, I had a panic attack. We were doing the prosthetics when I had the attack because I’m claustrophobic. I broke into a sweat and could feel the blood rushing through my feet, and I remember saying to myself, ‘I can’t do this’. Throughout the film, I was breathing through one nostril because of the prosthetics. I couldn’t eat properly because I couldn’t open my mouth completely. And then, there was the emotional journey. Having said that, I was willing to go through it all because this was a story we had to tell. That was more important than what I had to live with for a few hours every day. Whenever I felt low or vulnerable, I would think about Laxmi and the other survivors, who have been through so much, and that would help me pull through the day.When a director says that he/she would not have made a film without a particular actor, there is no bigger compliment for that actor. Often in Indian cinema, we make films with roles that are replaceable. Isko nahin toh usko lo, usko nahin to kisi aur ko lo. I’m glad that today, we are getting to a point where films are written in a certain way, where characters are so special that either you make it with a cast that you have in mind or you don’t make it at all. When Meghna narrated this script to to me, I was instantly drawn to the subject. What I was also drawn to was her honesty. I could see her sincerity, sensitivity and a great sense of responsibility. I had seen all of these things in her movie, ‘Talvar’ (2015). It was incredible the way that movie was made — it was such a fragile topic and it was made at a time when the people on whom the film was based were still in custody. Films like these engage you, make a point, and at the same time, are entertaining. It’s difficult to find a director who can strike that balance.I admire her spirit. Also, her ability to articulate her thoughts and feelings. She is honest, candid, confident and has a great sense of humour. She has beautiful hair, too.I hope the film resonates with people at multiple levels, whether it’s pertaining to the legal system, the sale of acid or how we look at women who’ve suffered an acid attack. We tend to treat the survivors as disabled; they don’t have any disability and it’s important for us as a society to recognise that.Actually, I have had a couple of people tell me in the past that I would make a good producer. Dinesh Vijan (filmmaker) was the first person to tell me that. He would say, ‘Deepu, one day we will become partners and I’ll make a cabin for you in my office’. At that point, I didn’t think I would produce a film someday. But now when I look back, I remember how during ‘Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’ (2013), I would ask Karan Johar (producer) why he was giving Ayan Mukerji (director) so much liberty with the budget and why he was allowing him to do recce at different places. I think somewhere, I was always interested in what goes on behind the scenes as much as what happens in front of the camera.Yes, it’s totally possible, so it all depends on the choices one makes. Like the next film I’m doing is a romantic thriller, which is very different from what I have done so far. I have been offered many sports biopics, too, but I haven’t decided on that, yet.He’s not there yet, but he does try! We have both rubbed off on each other in different ways. I’d like to believe that I have brought in a little more professionalism and discipline into his life. I think he would like to believe that he has brought out the quirky side of me, though I think I have always been like that, it’s just that people saw it in spurts. There is an extremely goofy and funny side to me, which only close friends got to see earlier. Now, when I sometimes show that side of my personality to others, people feel that he has rubbed off on me, which is also a great thing. Ranveer and I support and encourage each other... especially his dressing sense! In a way, there are not many changes from the time we were dating, except that now, we come home to each other. Professionally, we make our own decisions and personally, we decide everything together. For us, it’s been important from the beginning that we retain our own identities. People around us often forget that we are married, which I think is a good thing. Ranveer and I are together and at the same time, we are our own people.Maybe I’m showing it a lot more now. If you ever speak to my school friends, they will tell you that I was a brat. My mother will tell you how, as a child, I was never at ground level; I was always jumping or climbing somewhere. There is a boisterous side to me, which, in all of my so-called elegance, people missed seeing.No! I have not been asked this question ever, which is refreshing.There is no truth to that at all.We don’t think like that at all. We would rather think whether a film warrants the two of us to come together. Again, that’s not a decision for us to make, it’s for the director to decide. We have not been offered anything like that together, though it was refreshing to work with him in ‘83 after having worked in three films, where we die in the end! I hope we get to do more films, maybe something more contemporary and lighter. It’ll be nice for someone to explore our on-screen combination in a different way from what everyone has seen so far.I feel gratitude. Nothing fell into my lap, I have worked hard to reach where I am, and to be a part of the kind of films that I get to do today. I want to constantly learn, grow and evolve. I also used the criticism that came my way, constructively. And, I am thankful for the goodwill and support that I got.Yes. I don’t think I was the same person even seven years ago. Every film, every experience, every success, failure, criticism and praise has led me to where I am today. It allows me to grow further, think, express and take risks.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73140323,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-46800/73140323.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/deepika-padukone-i-have-a-boisterous-side-which-in-all-of-my-so-called-elegance-people-missed-seeing/articleshow/73140083.cms

12,['8/01/2020'],Basant Bhatt replaces Pratham Kunwar in TV show 'Vighnaharta Ganesha',"Replacements are common in the television industry, but this one in particular has caught our fancy. Pratham Kunwar , who stepped into the shoes of Basant Bhatt to play the new Kartikey in ' Vighnaharta Ganesha ', has now been replaced by the latter. Pratham, who joined the cast in September after Basant quit citing date issues, has now exited the mythological show.Pratham says, “To begin with, I wasn’t happy with the way my character was shaping up. Out of the 15 days a month blocked by the production house, I was being called to shoot for only three days. They promised me that my track will increase soon, however, that didn’t happen. They eventually told me that they are getting the original actor back. I was shocked. Having said that, I don’t grudge anyone, as I feel fortunate to have got the opportunity to play such an iconic character. The only grouse is that I had chosen this project over another that I was offered around the same time.”On his part, Basant says, “Apparently, the channel wanted me back in the show for the upcoming track and hence, the production house approached me. I hadn’t quit 'Vighnaharta Ganesha'. In fact, I was managing it along with ' RadhaKrishn ', but it became difficult to adjust the schedule of other artistes. That’s when the production house decided to get in another actor to play the part. I am back now and am willing to put in extra hours for the show.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73141388,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-62057/73141388.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/basant-bhatt-replaces-pratham-kunwar-in-tv-show-vighnaharta-ganesha/articleshow/73141373.cms

But what made it even more significant for the Marathas was the fortress’ strategic value and emotional importance for Shivaji Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established control of the Kondhana fort as a 16-year-old in 1646. It was one of his first military victories, which is why the fort continued to hold a special place for him emotionally.The fortress was located in a region that formed as the gateway to the heart of what would later become the Maratha Empire. Whoever controlled it could easily control the region. It was built on the edge of a cliff 760 metres above the ground with natural protection in extremely steep slopes. Hence, it was considerd impenetrable, which made Tanhaji conquering it with just 300 men such an impressive featThe Marathas, under Shivaji, confronted the Mughals from 1657-64, registering several important victories. In 1665, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent Rajput commander Mirza Raja Jai Singh I with a force of 15,000 to defeat Shivaji. After luring several of Shivaji’s commanders into Mughal service, Jai Singh cornered him at Purandar, forcing him to surrenderAfter his defeat in 1665, Shivaji signed a treaty with the Mughals, surrendering 23 forts – including Kondhana – apart from agreeing to become a Mughal vassal. This is how his treasured fortress went under Mughal controlIn 1670, after relations between Shivaji and the Mughals soured, he launched a massive reconquest. Kondhana was one of the first forts he targetted. The win at Kondhana enabled his armies to win back most of the lost territory within four months. In 1674, Shivaji was crowned the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.

14,['8/01/2020'],"Students turn to counsellors, helplines to manage parental pressure and anxiety","Though doctors say that exam stress is common, parental pressure and their high expectations add to the students' anxiety. ""It is not just about exams, but parents and peers also put a lot of pressure on students when it comes to picking a career path,"" say counsellors. They also emphasise that it's necessary for parents to stop pressurising their kids in order for them to not only perform well, but also be in a better state of mind. ""I was never stressed about giving my board exams but my parents had such high expectations from me that I actually ended up stressing a lot about my exams. I had studied enough but I was not at all confident because my parents would keep asking me about my syllabus and they kept worrying about the exams. A month prior to my exams, I finally called one of the exam helplines to discuss my problem, and instead of my parents calming me down, I was the one telling them to take it easy, otherwise I wouldn’t be able to perform,"" shares Rashika Soni, a 17-year-old who sat for her board exams last year.From seeking help from counsellors to sharing problems with loved ones, experts suggest how rather than cracking under pressure, students should seek help for their mental well-being.Anjana Anand, a career counsellor, says, ""It is very important for us to connect with the child because if I am counselling a kid about their career, it is crucial for me to understand what he/she is going through. As far as dealing with stress or anxiety is concerned, we should be able to identify early signs. When there is a problem, accept that there is an issue, there is nothing wrong with it. It is okay to say, 'I am feeling anxious, or I am feeling very negative today'. Acknowledge that and seek help.""Each year, Central Board of Secondary Education opens its helpline numbers to help students tackle exam-related stress and anxiety. In 2017, as per the data shared by the CBSE, between February 1 and February 15, as many as 1,356 calls were received on their helpline numbers. Out of these calls, 619 were made for psychological counselling by students. ""As students, we already feel the pressure to score well, but when our parents start comparing us to our siblings or their friend’s kids, it doesn’t help. Most students call helplines because they just need someone to listen,"" says Pooja Negi, a 17-year-old school student who lives in Mayur Vihar.Sometimes, it's not just the parents' expectations that cause anxiety amongst students. ""My daughter would often tell me that she was having trouble solving some mathematics equations. So I took her to a counsellor to simply talk about it and it actually helped. Sometimes, our kids are not able to share what they are actually feeling with us, but the involvement of a third party actually helps,"" shares Jovita Sharma, a resident of Sector 31, Gurgaon.The National Mental Health Survey 2015-16, conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, revealed that 9.8 million teenagers in the age group of 13-17 years suffer depression and other mental health disorders and are ""in need of active intervention"".Samir Parikh, Director & HOD, Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Hospital shares that their counselling helpline numbers get 100 calls from school and college students every day. ""Exams, marks, entrance tests are part of our lives. No matter what we do, there is always going to be that pressure. Kids understand that their parents have high expectations from them. There is so much competitiveness that one's self-esteem is defined by a comparison to someone else, which has a negative impact. That is why we tell them to seek help from people who can guide them and ask parents to be open with their kids,"" he says.""Parents often have a vision for their kids and they then put a lot of pressure on them to choose a field that they want. In 90% of the cases, kids don't choose the field of study that they really want. For example, even some schools don’t support humanities. Once, a student came to me and said that when he told his principal that he wanted to take humanities, she laughed and said, 'But you are a good student! Why humanities?' This is why majority of the students end up taking subjects that they don’t want to study,"" shares Yashi Shukla, a career counsellor.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73140552,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1229324/73140552.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/students-turn-to-counsellors-helplines-to-manage-parental-pressure-anxiety/articleshow/73140447.cms
15,['8/01/2020'],Forecast puts GDP growth at 11-year low of 5%,"(Representative image)

GDP data points to weak investment in FY20

NEW DELHI: The economy is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in 11 years in 2019-20, dragged down by anaemic manufacturing, slowing services sector growth, as well as sluggish investment and consumption. With the Union Budget less than a month away, the dismal forecast will add pressure on the authorities to revive the economy.The National Statistical Office on Tuesday forecast GDP growth to be 5% in 2019-20, slower than the previous year's 6.8% and in line with the RBI estimate. If this growth is realised, then it would be the slowest since 3.1% posted in 2008-09 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Nominal GDP , which is the market value of goods and services produced in the economy but not adjusted for inflation, is estimated to grow at a42-year low of 7.5%.Manufacturing is estimated to slow to 2% in 2019-20 from 6.9% the previous year while the services sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of the economy, is forecast to grow by 6.9%, slower than 7.5% in the previous year.Economists said there is a sharp decline in the growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) from 10% in FY19 (revised estimate) to 1% in FY20 (advance estimate), reflecting the subdued investment activity in the economy.""These numbers must be read with caution as the methodology clearly says that these are extrapolations of the existing data on various sectors which could range from 6 months to 8 months. Therefore there is scope for change in these numbers when the actual numbers are reckoned,' said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings referring to the overall numbers.The lower nominal growth is also expected to upset the government's fiscal calculations. ""For FY20 the budgeted nominal GDP growth rate was 12% which has now been revised downwards to 7.5%. Based on this GDP revision, the impact on the fiscal deficit is around 12 basis points (100 basis points equal a percentage point) for FY20,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI.The government aims to rein in the fiscal deficit at 3.3% of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year but the pressure on revenues may widen the deficit. There have been calls for relaxing the deficit target to provide space for stimulus to the economy but the government has so far maintained that it will stick to the path of fiscal consolidation.Economists said demand drivers such as private consumption, investment and net exports are down with the exception of government expenditure. ""The growth slowdown especially in private consumption to 5.8% in FY20 from 8.1% in FY19 has taken the sting out of FY20 GDP growth because this alone constitutes 57.4% of the total GDP,"" said Sunil Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research.""We believe that the advance estimates of 5% GDP growth is not sacrosanct. There are risks,"" he said.In Video: Forecast puts GDP growth at 11-year low of 5%",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73146691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-74898,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/forecast-puts-gdp-growth-at-11-year-low-of-5/articleshow/73146712.cms

NEW DELHI: A high-powered panel has cleared the road for rolling out nearly 150 private trains on 100 routes, including Mumbai-Delhi and Howrah-Delhi sectors, which will compete with Rajdhani.While two Tejas trains have been handed over for running by Railways-controlled IRCTC on the Delhi-Lucknow and Mumbai-Ahmedabad routes as an experiment with the ""private sector"", the committee's report is likely to pave the way for a massive competition to the services currently being offered by the state transporter.The panel was set up by minister Piyush Goyal after Railway Board chairman VK Yadav flagged off private trains in the Centre's 100 days' agenda.The recommendations put out for stakeholder consultations have proposed that Indian as well as global players, with experience in railway and tourism sectors be permitted, provided they have a minimum net worth of Rs 450 crore. Other performance parameters, like a maximum-permissible 15-minute delay, beyond which passengers will have to be compensated, have been proposed. On IRCTC-run Tejas trains, a similar facility has been offered.The routes have been divided into seven clusters with a clear plan to develop infrastructure in less utilised stations such as Panvel near Mumbai and Tilak Bridge and Okhla in Delhi for running long-distance trains.The train routes have been primarily identified on Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Kolkata routes as the railways is hopeful of freeing up tracks by December 2021, when both Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors will become fully operational and take over the burden of handling goods traffic. The railways has also approved the plan to improve the existing tracks on these two routes to allow trains to run at 160 kmph, which has been proposed as the speed limit for private trains.According to the plan, the time taken by a train to complete a journey will be comparable with the fastest train operated by the Indian Railways on that route. And, to provide comfort to private players, the railways will not run regular trains on the same route within 15 minutes of the scheduled operation of the private train.Private operators will be free to fix the fare, decide on halts and procure coaches and engines from any source as long as they comply with the railways' standards. The private players will have to deploy all the trains within five years of award of contract.The idea is to offer better quality service on these trains, while also seeking investments, estimated at over Rs 22,000 crore, for the railways to reverse the trend of losing passenger traffic to airlines. And, the plan is to move in swiftly with the panel headed by NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant suggesting that the first train can be rolled out within six months of the award, with 35-year contracts to be awarded to entities offering to pay the highest revenue share.According to government data, the current railway network is about 68,000 route km.In 2018-19, the reserved passenger volume was 16% (590 million) of the total originating non-suburban passengers and almost 8.85 crore of wait-listed passengers could not be accommodated.""There is hence a critical requirement to introduce private operations in passenger train which will allow introduction of next-generation technology , ensuring use of improved coach technology and reduced journey time,"" an official document said justifying the need to allow private players to run trains.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73146874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-520774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panel-gives-green-signal-to-150-private-trains-on-100-routes/articleshow/73146750.cms

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: Exchanging New Year greetings , Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump discussed way to enhance Indo-US cooperation in areas of mutual interest and reviewed regional security issues .

The telephonic conversation came on the back of tensions in the Gulf region , days after the killing of top Iranian commander General Qassim Suleimani in a US strike .

""Today, President Donald J Trump spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to exchange New Year's greetings,"" the White House said in a statement.

""The leaders discussed ways to further strengthen the United States-India strategic partnership in 2020, and they also reviewed regional security matters,"" the White House said. It didn't elaborate on the ""regional security matters"" discussed by Modi and Trump.

Modi, according to a PMO statement on Tuesday, ""stated that India-US relations, which are built on trust, mutual respect and understanding, have grown from strength to strength"". ""The PM highlighted the significant progress made in deepening the strategic partnership between the two countries in the previous year and expressed his desire to continue to work with President Trump for enhancing cooperation in all areas of mutual interest,"" it said. Monday's telephonic call was the first contact between the two leaders in the New Year and possibly the first for President Trump with an international leader on his return to the White House after his year-end vacation.

President Trump expressed satisfaction at the achievements in the Indo-US relationship in the last few years and reiterated his readiness for further deepening of bilateral cooperation.

In 2019, Prime Minister Modi and Donald Trump met four times, including their joint appearance at the 'Howdy Modi!' event in Houston.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar had earlier spoken to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and voiced India's concerns over escalating tensions in the Gulf region after Suleimani's killing.

Jaishankar also spoke to his counterparts from Qatar and Jordan on Monday night to get a sense of the evolving situation in the Gulf. He had spoken to foreign ministers of Iran and Oman earlier.

Protesters clash with cops after a student was killed when a police vehicle hit a car in Nowgam area of Srinag... Read More

NEW DELHI: The Centre has invited a group of foreign envoys posted in India to travel to Jammu & Kashmir on January 9-10 to see for themselves the ground situation in the Valley. The newly re-organised Union territory has been off-limits for foreign diplomats since August 2019.

According to sources, the government has reached out to around 18 diplomats from European and other western countries as well as some countries from Gulf and OIC members.

India has come in for international criticism for the communication blackout , which has now been lifted, as well as political detentions of elected politicians in Kashmir . Not all the invitations have been accepted, as diplomats have sought clarity on how independent they would be during their visit. The government has been at pains to allay their concerns, and promised them access to local officials, leaders, ordinary Kashmiris and security officials.

In October, the government facilitated an NGO called Madi Group, which escorted a group of 23 members of European parliament to Kashmir to meet some locals and get classified security briefings. The visit was criticised for the fact that MEPs represented far-right political parties in their countries. Their missions here insisted that they had come as individuals, not as representatives of their countries, which sort of defeated the purpose of the visit.

The current visit is intended for representatives of governments, and therefore, holds greater weight.

21,['8/01/2020'],"Meanwhile, a bid to start ‘political process’ as ‘third front’ calls on LG","This story is from January 8, 2020

SRINAGAR: Eight former legislators of Jammu & Kashmir, led by Syed Altaf Bukhari, on Tuesday became the first group of mainstream politicians to open a channel of communication with the office of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) and make a slew of demands, including restoration of statehood and release of political prisoners .

The delegation submitted a memorandum to LG Girish Chandra Murmu, also seeking protection of land and job rights of permanent residents. The former legislators urged the UT government to restore internet connectivity in all regions of J&K as a part of confidence-building measure and an outreach to the public.

Later, a Raj Bhavan spokesman confirmed the group's visit, saying: ""A delegation of former legislators and politicians led by ex-minister Syed Altaf Bukhari met the lieutenant governor at the Raj Bhavan in Jammu on Tuesday. This is the beginning of the political process with mainstream parties.""

Bukhari, a former PDP minister, who was later expelled from the party after the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti-led government in 2018, has reportedly collected the group of disgruntled former PDP MLAs and MLCs, besides his long-time friend Ghulam Hassan Mir, who is the president of the Democratic Party Nationalist, to form a third front in the absence of NC and PDP top leaders, who have been in jail since the revocation of special status of J&K. Parliament had on August 5 last year nullified Articles 370 and 35A, and ororganised the erstwhile state into two Union Territories - J&K and Ladakh.

Besides Bukhari and Mir, the other members who formed the delegation are: Mohammad Dilawar Mir, Zaffar Iqbal, Javed Hassan Beig, Noor Mohammad Sheikh, Choudhary Qamar Hussain and Raja Manzoor Ahmad.

""We take this opportunity to solicit your attention towards the socio-political and economic situation that emerged since August 5, 2019. Since the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status embedded in Article 370 of the Indian Constitution and bifurcation of the State into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one - the majority of its residents are yet to reconcile with this decision,"" the memorandum said.

The memorandum further said: ""Although it is heartening that Kashmir remained peaceful and no fatalities were recorded due to enhanced security measures and other administrative efforts, the credit must go to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who showed extreme maturity while registering their peaceful protest.

""Fact of the matter is that a majority of people in Jammu and Kashmir feel hurt and there are vocal concerns wherein they feel their decades-long privileges were unceremoniously curtailed.""

The leaders further conveyed to the LG that, in order to win over the confidence of the people of Jammu and Kashmiri, the Centre should re-examine its decades-old policies vis-à-vis Kashmir.

""Depending solely on security measures and dealing with people's political aspirations through the law and order prism will always have its old, tested repercussions,"" the memorandum said.

The memorandum also said that the nullification of Article 370 and, in particular, annulling of Article 35A on account of being ""discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir"" and it being ""an obstacle in the development of the state"" have outstanding issues.

""As we know, Article 35A, among its various provisions, granted special rights to permanent residents of J&K for, (i) employment under the State Government; (ii) acquisition of immovable property in the State; (iii) settlement in the State … and, of course, defining such residents,"" the memorandum said.

File photo for representation

NEW DELHI: Banking, transport and other services across the country are likely to be hit as trade unions have called a nationwide strike on Wednesday.

Nearly 25 crore people are said to be taking part in this all-India strike to protest against the government's ""anti-people"" policies.

Ten central trade unions like INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC along with various sectoral independent federations and associations had adopted a declaration in September last to go on a nationwide strike on January 8, 2020.

Several banks have already informed stock exchanges about the Wednesday strike and its impact on banking services. Various bank employee associations, including AIBEA, All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA), BEFI, INBEF, INBOC and Bank Karmachari Sena Mahasangh, have expressed their willingness to participate in the strike.

Banking services like deposit and withdrawal, cheque clearing and instrument issuance are expected to be impacted due to the strike. However, services at private sector banks are unlikely to be impacted.

Other than banking, transport and other key services are also likely to be disrupted in many states due to this nationwide strike call.

In West Bengal, trade unions affiliated to Left and other parties called for a bandh against the economic policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre.

However, the state government said it will not support any bandh.

""The ministry of labour has failed to assure on any of the demands of workers which called a meeting on January 2, 2020. The attitude of the government is that of contempt towards labour as we construe from its policies and actions,"" the 10 CTUs said in a joint statement.

""We expect participation of not less than 25 crore of working people in the forthcoming national general strike on January 8, 2020, to be followed by many more actions seeking reversal of the anti-worker, anti-people, anti-national policies of the government,"" it said.

The central government, meanwhile, has asked public sector undertakings to dissuade their employees from participating in the "" Bharat Bandh "" called on Wednesday and advised them to prepare a contingency plan to ensure smooth functioning of the enterprises. Meanwhile, in Kerala, the trade unions exempted the state's tourism sector from Wednesdays general strike. Kerala Travel Mart society hailed as ""exemplary"" the decision by political parties and trade unions to exempt the state's tourism sector from Wednesdays general strike.

NEW DELHI: Onion supplies are expected to be remain under pressure during January and February with domestic production in 2020 expected to top the 2019 level only in March, providing relief to consumers complaining of high prices of the kitchen staple.

Estimates available with the Centre suggested that production in January is expected to be one-third lower than the corresponding period last year, with the decline projected at 25% in February (see graphic).

Despite the supply gap, states are, however, reluctant to lift imported onions to bridge the deficit on account of damage to the crop in the wake of heavy rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Sources said till now about 12,000 tonnes of imported onion arrived of the total 41,950 tonnes contracted by the state-run trading agency MMTC. ""States have lifted only 3,000 tonnes,"" said a source. Union consumer affairs secretary AK Srivastava admitted that the states were not picking up stocks, although they had earlier committed to buy more. ""On the basis of their demand of 33,000 tonnes, the government had gone ahead with the plan to import 41,950 tonnes. But now their demand has fallen by half to only 14309 tonnes,"" he said.

Srivastava said the issue of states hesitating to lift imported onion was discussed at a meeting chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba on Tuesday. Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Centre will now sell imported onion to states at Rs 49-58 per kg for retail distribution to check prices.

""We have imported so far 12,000 tonnes of onion from countries like Turkey and Afghanistan. Of this, 1,000 tonnes have already been distributed to states,"" he said.

GUWAHATI: The rift in Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) came out in public once again on Tuesday as former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was not allowed to hold a meeting at the party's headquarters in Guwahati. Mahanta was forced to shift his meeting to another venue.

AGP, which is in alliance with BJP, has been divided on the CAA, which grants citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Mahanta and his followers have been against the legislation, while party president Atul Bora and his other two party colleagues in the government, Keshab Mahanta and Phani Bhushan Choudhury, the lone Rajya Sabha member from AGP Birendra Prasad Baishya, are on theother side.

On Tuesday, Mahanta was in for a surprise when he reached the party headquarters for holding an interactive session with grassroots level workers only to find a huge lock at the gate. Security personnel posted outside the gate told Mahanta and his followers to back off.

Mahanta did hold the meet, but it had to be rescheduled by a few hours to another venue. In his speech, Mahanta told his supporters, ""Those supporting CAA in AGP must join BJP. AGP had earlier taken a resolution opposing CAA .""

Mahanta was accompanied by legislator Pabindra Deka and former party president Brindaban Goswami.

Deka appealed to party workers to be united and resolutely oppose CAA. In the meeting, workers urged Mahanta and those backing him to take a resolution against the party leadership, who have been backing the CAA.

JAIPUR: More skeletons are tumbling out of JK Lon Hospital in Kota where more than 112 children have died in the last 37 days.

When Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma directed the authorities to take stock of medical equipment being used in state government hospitals, it was found that Chinese medical equipment of inferior grade were being used. ""I have directed additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh to investigate the matter and find out who is behind the purchase of such equipment,"" Sharma told reporters on Tuesday.

""Whoever is behind it is playing with the health of children. For saving the lives of children, inferior Chinese medical equipment was purchased, which might put the health of children at risk,"" he said.

A complete report will be prepared and submitted to the health minister. Sharma also issued directions that a centralised system for monitoring medical equipment be developed. TOI had published a report, ""Over 50% of gadgets in Kota hospital where kids died defunct"", on December 30. Now a system will be put in place to record monitoring requirements, purchase and maintenance of medical equipment.

Another shortcoming at J K Lon Hospital was the absence of a centralised oxygen system . Oxygen cylinders are supplied to the hospital by cart. The health minister has directed officials to identify all hospitals in the state that lack a centralised oxygen system. ""We will install centralised oxygen systems in all hospitals in a phase-wise manner,"" said Sharma.

Over 1,000 Indian soldiers, including over 35 officers, have lost their lives in the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region since April 1984, when India's Operation Meghdhoot pre-empted Pakistan's Operation Ababeel to occupy almost all the dominating heights from 16,000 to 22,000-feet by a whisker.

Around three-fourths of the casualties are caused by the severe terrain and climatic conditions there.

CHENNAI: In a legal setback to former Union minister P Chidambaram 's son, Karti Chidambaram , an MP from Sivaganga constituency, a special court has declined to discharge him and his wife Srinidhi from an income tax prosecution for non-disclosure of income .

Rejecting their pleas on Tuesday, special judge D Lingeshwaran directed the couple to be present in court on January 21 for framing of charges and made it clear that if they failed to appear on the next hearing date, the court would have to issue warrants against them.

Special public prosecutor M Sheela submitted that Karti, his wife Srinidhi, and his mother Nalini Chidambaram had sold their lands at Muttukadu, near Chennai, to Agni Estates and Foundations Pvt Ltd at Rs 4.25 crore per acre.

As per the complaint made, Karti had not disclosed the receipt of the cash component in his income tax return for assessment year 2014-15 and Srinidhi in her return for the assessment year 2015-16.

Moving the plea to discharge him, Karti submitted that the alleged cash payments were made only three months after the accused had filed his income tax returns for assessment year 2014-15. Therefore, he said, on the date of filing his return he had not received the cash.

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: In a move to boost research in drug manufacturing , the government is considering to restore tax benefits on research and development (R&D) expenditure incurred by local pharmaceutical companies in the upcoming Budget 2020 .

This is one of the key recommendations made by the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) as part of its budget proposal to the finance ministry, an official source said. The pharmaceutical industry is hopeful that the government will restore the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on R&D to 200%.

At present, the industry enjoys 150% weighted deduction on R&D but it is scheduled to come down to 100% from 2020 unless the government takes a call on it.

The government had introduced a weighted tax deduction of 200% on expenditure on R&D in the 2010 budget, in order to boost innovation in the country. However, the government slashed the benefit to 150% from 2017 onwards and 100% from 2020.

Besides the deduction on research, the department has also suggested offering some incentives to encourage domestic manufacturing of bulk drugs or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) used as raw material in the formulation of medicine.

By a three to two majority, the bench referred the issue, including laying down the guidelines for adjudication of cases involving a clash between faith and fundamental rights , to a seven-judge bench.

However, on Monday, CJI SA Bobde entrusted the task to a nine-judge bench headed by him. Others on the bench are Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, Mohan M Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant.

On September 28, 2018, the SC had by four to one majority termed the custom unconstitutional and had thrown open the Sabarimala temple to women of all ages. Justice Malhotra was the lone dissenting voice who said courts should not interfere with faith and customs of a religion. More than 50 review petitions were filed against the decision.

Mehak Mirza Prabhu holds a poster reading 'Free Kashmir' in Mumbai during a protest against the violence at JN... Read More

MUMBAI: The Colaba police on Tuesday evening filed an FIR against Mehak Mirza Prabhu, the woman protester at the Gateway of India whose placard reading 'Free Kashmir' kicked up a storm with former CM Devendra Fadnavis and others alleging the agitation in support of JNU students had taken on a divisive character.

Mehak, who had participated in the protest on Monday, was booked under Section 153B of the Indian Penal Code for imputations and assertions prejudicial to national integration. No arrest has been made. If convicted, an accused booked under this charge could face imprisonment for a maximum of five years.

The FIR was filed suo moto by Colaba police. It came after home minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP said earlier in the day that the state would carry out a probe into the matter and after Shiv Sena and NCP leaders had defended Mehak.

The woman herself sought to clarify her position in a video she put out on social media and in a chat with TOI, saying she was speaking only of ""basic constitutional rights"" and ""freedom of expression"" in J&K in view of the ""internet shutdown"" there.

A senior police officer said they would examine Mehak's profile on social media. ""We have to scan all the information about her in order to establish in what context she was carrying the poster,"" an IPS officer said on Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking about what she termed as the ""abuse, hate and narrative"" that the image of her holding up the poster had spawned, Mehak told TOI, ""I have been in too much distress. I'm an artiste, I tell stories and I was there like everyone else with no other agenda. I did not write or create that poster. It was lying around, which I happened to lift and hold up.""

Stating that things had been ""blown out of proportion"" and she had been labelled as a ""member of a gang,"" the 37-year-old stressed on her background as a Maharashtrian and a storytelling artiste. ""The picture created by social media came as an absolute shock to me,"" she said. ""If by being naive in understanding the impact it would have, and in the process (having) created this stir, I apologise. As a woman it is scary for my safety.""

38,['8/01/2020'],SC to government: Look into notes with jihadi messages,"This story is from January 8, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Union government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it will examine allegations in a PIL that the Reserve Bank of India 's Jammu branch had, in contravention of rules, exchanged currency notes worth Rs 30 crore which were embossed with Kashmiri separatist slogans .

On a petition filed by Amritsar-based Satish Bharadwaj, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether ""central agencies have done anything on this issue""? The bench asked the SG whether the court should issue notice to the Centre or it would examine the matter on its own. When Mehta said the government would look into it, the bench adjourned hearing on the petition.

Quoting a TOI report of August 19, 2013, from Srinagar which said separatist slogans were being stamped on Indian currency notes, the petitioner said he inquired and found that ""defaced/imperfect Indian currency notes worth Rs 30 crore were exchanged with fresh currency notes by Jammu regional branch office of RBI on the instruction of then regional director of Jammu branch of RBI"". The money allegedly belonged to a separatist group.

Bharadwaj said exchange of defaced currency notes was against the RBI (Note Refund) Rules, 2009, which stipulate that ""no claim can be made against any currency notes which is imperfect or mutilated, or which carry any extrinsic words or visible representation which is intended to convey any message of a political or religious character or furthering the interest of any person or entity"".

Seeking a CBI inquiry into the matter, Bharadwaj said embossing notes with separatist slogans by militant groups was ""an act to disrupt law and order and destabilise India by creating an environment of tension and terror "". Bharadwaj said he had sought informationnon the matter from the RBI in February last year but the bank termed the query to be in the nature of ""opinion/justification/reason"".

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the first International Yoga Day Media Awards, Javadekar also said a misunderstanding over JNU was deliberately being spread in the varsity and others parts of the country to incite violence.

Javadekar also claimed selective ""anarchists"" were raising slogans for a ""Free Kashmir"" even though ""the entire country"" supported revocation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir. He said Kashmir remains an inseparable part of India and claimed that peace ""has been prevailing"" in J&K and that the region is ""making progress since Article 370 of the Constitution was repealed"".

""The entire country is supporting the move... a few selective anarchists are raising such kind of slogans. Nobody even inside Kashmir raised such slogans. Now if someone outside the region gives such slogan, that makes no sense,"" Javadekar further said.

Conferring the Yoga Day Media Awards, Javadekar said the honouor was instituted to felicitate media organisations that had contributed to spread yoga as beneficial to society. He appreciated efforts by the media and said the event, the first of its kind, marked a new trend of recognising the endeavour of media organisations going beyond news, views and advertisements.

Referring to yoga as an Indian brand that has gained global respect due to PM Modi'sefforts, Javadekar said the United Nations supported India's proposal for an International Day of Yoga.

NEW DELHI: The government is looking at linking the refund of goods and services tax ( GST ) to ""risky and new"" exporters with remittance of foreign exchange apart from accessing bank transaction details as part of an exercise to plug revenue leakage.The issues were discussed at a meeting of top tax officers with revenue secretary AB Pandey on Tuesday, where it was decided to put in place a standard operating procedure (SOP) to fix fraudulent refund claims , including those related to sectors where the final product has higher GST than inputs and raw materials.A committee of state and central officers has been tasked with finalising the SOP within a week so that it can be implemented by the end of the month.To ensure better scrutiny of data, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will enter into an arrangement to share data with GST Network (GSTN) and Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) on a quarterly basis, instead of the current mechanism of an online exchange, an official release said.This will help in profiling those indulging in frauds. Data analysis has already helped in detecting widespread GST evasion, especially fraudulent refunds by fly-bynight operators. The recent investigation of Integrated GST refunds to exporters has prompted GST officers to look at new ways to protect revenue. One of the suggestions is to mandate a single bank account for foreign remittance receipt and refund disbursement for better tracking, although businesses said that the move was intrusive and would burden the entire industry due to the fault of a few entities.The officers also decided to explore access to banking transactions, including the bank account details by GST system, in consultation with RBI and NPCI. ""It was also explored to make GST system aligned with Financial Intelligence Unit for the purpose of getting bank account details and transactions and also PAN-based banking transaction,"" the statement said.Besides, all major cases of fake tax credit on inputs, export-import frauds and fraudulent refunds will also be probed by investigation wing of the income tax department.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73151741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54527,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-link-gst-refund-to-remittance-for-risky-exporters/articleshow/73147252.cms

PATNA: State project director of Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), Sanjay Kumar Singh, on Tuesday said the education department had been working towards digitization of all textbooks .

Speaking at a function organized to launch ‘Diksha’, an online portal of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Singh claimed that several mechanisms had been developed to provide quality education in government schools. “With the help of digital books, videos and online content, the teaching and learning outcomes will improve,” he said.

With ‘Diksha’, government schoolteachers will now have access to better resources for planning classroom activities. It will offer them engaging material relevant to the prescribed school curricula.

“We are planning to integrate the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) with ‘Diksha’ in future. An initiative of the BEPC, EMIS contains information like number of government schools, teachers, students, infrastructure and implementation of schemes,” the BEPC state project director said.

Singh also promised that the state government would provide funds to develop a digital content lab on the SCERT premises in Mahendru.

SCERT director Vinod Kumar Singh threw light on the features of ‘Diksha’, saying, “It is an initiative of the Centre, which many states, including Bihar, have adopted. Students can download ‘Diksha’ and scan the QR codes in their textbooks.”

Representative image

NAGPUR: Dozens of students in Nagpur won’t be able to secure admission in Std I in the 2020-21 academic session as they won’t turn six years of age by October 15, which is the most important criteria for admission.

The fault lies with schools which admitted these children a few years ago at nursery/KG level even though it was clear that they won’t turn six by the time they reach Std I. This never came up on the scanner because the education department’s control over schools start from Std I only. Now, the only option for those students is to repeat KG II and seek admission in Std I next year.

The state government introduced the minimum age criteria in a phased manner from the 2016-17 academic session with six years criteria being implemented from the current academic session.

Chintaman Vanjari, education officer ( Nagpur district ), said “Even last year we had a few cases like this. Students will have to repeat their kindergarten level because we cannot allow admissions in Std I if the child does not meet the age criteria.”

As per the earlier guidelines laid down by the education department, students should have completed six years of age on September 30 during the session when they take admission. A recent government resolution has allowed a relief of two weeks (October 15) for being able to complete the age criteria.

Some schools, mostly ‘budget’ ones, admitted students at pre-school level either due to ignorance or just to avoid missing out on admissions. Now three years later, such students find themselves stuck as they enter the ‘formal education’ phase of their lives.

Dipendra Lokhande, education officer (Chandrapur district), said “The data of all students being admitted in Std I is entered in a government portal. If the age criteria is not met, then the system won’t allow that admission. This portal, known by the acronym SARAL, exists only in Maharashtra and provides us a complete overview of statistics related to school education in the state.”

For education activists, the problem is who will pay the fee of such students who have to repeat KG II. Mohd Shahid Sharif, an education activist, said, “Parents are coming to our office and complaining about fees to be paid all over again. This is unfair to them as it is the responsibility of the school to ensure that all documentation is proper. Many times, parents are not aware of all the rules.”

Patna University

PATNA: Patna University (PU) has, of late, initiated several measures for ensuring better management of student-centric activities.

In a first, the size and format of degrees awarded to students after successful completion of their courses of studies have been changed in such a way that it would be easier to carry them. The practice of awarding huge-size degrees written in English only (Hindi version on demand and submission of additional fee) has been stopped and instead an A4 size degree containing both Hindi and English version on the same page has been introduced.

“The new degree format will also contain photograph of the candidate and his or her unique ID. Faking degrees and certificates will be very difficult now,” said a PU official. All the PU scholars received their degrees in new format at the convocation held on Saturday.

In another initiative, PU has strengthened its counselling, training and placement cell for providing the much-needed career counselling and securing jobs to the passouts of both conventional and vocational (self-financing) courses. “For the first time in 2019, several big companies visited the university and selected students from different institutions on the basis of written test and interview,” said PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh.

Quite recently, a full-fledged career centre was established on the campus with a view to enhancing the employability skills and providing necessary information to students about job avenues in different sectors. An MoU to this effect was signed between the PU’s placement cell and Medha Learning Foundation.

50,['8/01/2020'],"R-Power defaults, lenders face insolvency deadline","This story is from January 8, 2020

Mumbai: Reliance Power on Tuesday informed the stock exchanges that it has defaulted on a debt of Rs 685 crore. The company said that the default pertained to the quarter ended December 2019.

On July 6, 2019, all the main lenders of Reliance Power had signed an inter-creditor agreement (ICA). Based on the ICA , lenders had agreed to a six-month standstill, during which they would not initiate recovery of their loans. The objective of the standstill agreement was to implement a resolution plan during the same period. Reliance Power’s default has coincided with the expiry of the 210-day deadline set by the RBI for resolving all stressed loans through an inter-creditor agreement allowed under the central bank’s June 6, 2019 circular. In terms of the circular, if banks failed to arrive at a resolution by January 7, they would have to either initiate insolvency proceedings or set aside as additional provisions, 20% of the stressed loan.

Lenders, through Indian Banks Association, have sought more time from the RBI to complete resolutions of some stressed loans, including loans to the power sector. They have said that their efforts would go waste if they are forced to abandon the resolution discussions and initiate insolvency proceedings because of the deadline expiry. In July 2019, rating agency ICRA had downgraded the company from ‘C’ with a tag ‘issuer non-cooperating’ to ‘D’ on confirmation of delays in debt servicing. “The liquidity profile of the company, along with its subsidiaries, continues to remain stretched as evident from the considerable decline in the net cash accruals in FY19 and net-worth erosion due to significant impairment of assets,” ICRA had said.

51,['8/01/2020'],Religare Finvest debt deal to be test case for lenders,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: The debt resolution of Religare Enterprises’s troubled finance arm Religare Finvest through the sale of the company to the Chatterjee group’s TCG Advisory Services is likely to be a test case for RBI ’s inter-creditor agreement (ICA).

This is the first instance of a debt resolution being approved under the ICA platform in terms of RBI’s June 7, 2019 circular with 25% of lenders dissenting.

Under the inter-creditor agreement, three fourths of the lenders to Religare Finvest have agreed to a resolution proposal where Religare Enterprises will divest its entire stake in Religare Finvest to TCG Advisory Services. In a notice to the stock exchange, the company said that it now has until under March 3, 2020, as against December 2019 earlier, to finalise the deal.

What makes this a test case is that until now most resolutions through inter-creditor agreement have involved all of them agreeing to a resolution plan. The ICA is a platform where lenders can enter into a settlement with defaulting management without initiating insolvency proceedings. The RBI allows a deal to be approved if 75% of lenders by value and 60% by number agree on a resolution plan. However, the circular also requires that majority lenders protect rights of dissenting lenders by paying them at least the liquidation value. However, it is not clear who will pay the dissenting lenders.

Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda and the banks that will merge into them who together account for less than 25% of the debt have not approved the deal. “The way assenting creditors compensate the dissenting creditors will set a precedent for other similar case which has dissenting creditors,” said a senior bank official.

“If the dissenting lenders are not treated fairly, they could exercise their right to move bankruptcy court which would negate all the attempts put by lenders and new owners to revive the company,” added the senior official.

According to one of the lenders, the plan is to split the total debt crore into sustainable and unsustainable in the ratio of 51:49. Servicing the debt entails additional funding of Rs 3,000 crore over the next three years. The new promoter TPG will bring in Rs 330-odd crore upfront and additional funds every year with a total commitment of close to Rs 1,000 crore.

52,['8/01/2020'],Das: Operation twist impact as expected,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Mumbai: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday said the market’s response to the central bank’s ‘ operation twist ’, was on expected lines. “The response to the two rounds of simultaneous buying and selling of government securities through OMOs (open market operations) is on expected lines,” Das said on the sidelines of an event at the central bank’s headquarters.

Das was referring to the process through which the RBI has started simultaneously buying government securities of 10-year tenure and selling short-term bonds of less than one year tenure, worth exactly the same amount. This is done to forcibly soften the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts, which is one of the main determinants of the lending rate by banks. However, by buying and selling government bonds worth same amount of money, such an operation does not impact the liquidity in the system.

Starting on December 23, the RBI has conducted three such operations, buying and selling gilts worth about Rs 10,000 crore. The benchmark yield has come down by about 20 basis points to 6.55% as of Tuesday. While the results of the first two were on expected lines, the impact of the third one is being evaluated, sources said.

53,['8/01/2020'],NOU and BRABU likely to get new VCs by month-end,"This story is from January 8, 2020

PATNA: Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU) in Muzaffarpur and Nalanda Open University (NOU) in Patna will soon get full-time vice-chancellors (VC). Magadh University (MU) in Bodh Gaya, on the other hand, will have a new pro-VC. The process for their appointment has begun and is likely to be finalized by the end of this month.

According to Raj Bhavan sources, the applications received for the posts of VCs and pro-VC of the three universities have already been screened by the chancellor’s secretariat. The shortlisted candidates have been called for interaction with the duly constituted search committee on January 19 and 20. After the committee submits the names recommended by it, the new appointments will be made by the chancellor in consultation with the chief minister.

Both BRABU and NOU have been functioning without regular VCs for the past few months. While the office of the VC in BRABU fell vacant when he was asked by the chancellor to resign few months ago, NOU VC Ravindra Kumar Sinha resigned on his own to join another university in Jammu. For some time, Purnea University VC Rajesh Singh was asked to officiate as the VC of BRABU, but he was soon replaced by pro-VC R K Mandal of the same university. Similarly, Patna University (PU) VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh was made to officiate as the VC of NOU after the resignation of Sinha, but was replaced by Patliputra University VC Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal.

The posts of VCs in Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU) and Jai Prakash University (JPU) have also been advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat. The last date for receipt of online applications ended on November 30 and their screening is reportedly going on. While TMBU is going without a regular VC for the past few months, the term of present incumbents in LNMU and JPU is likely to expire soon. JPU VC Harikesh Singh will complete his three-year term on January 24 and LNMU VC S K Singh will do so on March 20.

“In the coming months, the posts of VCs and pro-VCs of some more universities, including PU, will be advertised as the incumbents will complete their three-year terms shortly,” said sources.

Agra: Two members of an inter-state gang involved in looting trucks were arrested by Agra police and Rs 10 lakh worth pesticide seized from them. Two of their accomplices are on the run.

According to police, a month ago, a truck was stolen from a fuel station in Shamshabad area. While investigating the case, police found various CCTV footage of the truck which was seen heading towards Firozabad along with a SUV tailing it.

“The SUV belonged to family of one of the gang members. The police conducted a raid and arrested two men -- Raees (35), a resident of Hajipura, and Shahid (40) of Chamiya Tola under Rasoolpur police jurisdiction. Raees’ family runs a wholesale business of fruits. During interrogation, the accused confessed that they ran a gang of vehicle-lifters. The gang would steal or loot a truck laden with goods standing idle on the road side or parked at a fuel station. The gang recently stole Rs 10 lakh worth pesticide along with a truck from Karhal of Mainpuri district. We have recovered the pesticide from Khandauli- based godown,” said Arvind Kumar Nirval, SHO of Shamshabad.

“Two prime suspects -- Kuldeep Yadav and Mujaheed -- are still absconding. The gang sold the stolen goods in the local market, while using the trucks for their transport business. They would sell the vehicles to neighbouring states like Rajasthan and Delhi. Shahid, who was arrested, was earlier nabbed in Haldwani, Uttarakhand for vehicle- lifting,” added the SHO.

Meanwhile, Ganjdundwara police of Kasganj arrested three vehicle-lifters and seized a truck and two motorcycles from them. Those arrested were identified as Shahwaz, Tahir Hussain and Babloo.

55,['8/01/2020'],Gold prices soar to all-time high,"This story is from January 8, 2020

PATNA: Gold is glittering like never before. Geopolitical uncertainties and tension in the Middle East are likely to add further shine to the yellow metal, which was selling at Rs41,110 per 10gm (24 carat) in the city on Tuesday, the highest price so far. Also, 22 carat gold, which is mainly used in making jewellery, was sold at Rs39,150 per 10gm, with slight variations in its prices at different outlets.

Bullion traders claimed that surging gold prices are unlikely to hit the sales, especially when wedding season is to start from January 16. “Even though the prices of gold are increasing, it is not having much impact on sales as people buy and wear gold jewellery during wedding season owing to tradition,” said Jeevan Kumar, state secretary of Akhil Bhartiya Swarnkar Sangh.

Mohit Khemka, who owns a jewellery shop at Boring Road, also had similar views. “Though we were expecting a dull period in the coming wedding season due to rising gold prices, but it does not seem to be the case. There is no fall in the number of customers purchasing gold for wedding purposes. As usual, we are getting five to six such customers every day,” Khemka said, adding that many people are also investing in gold in the hope of further rise in its prices.

Even the buyers think so. Saguna Mor resident Ankita Sinha, who is busy in shopping for her brother Amitesh Sinha’s wedding scheduled in February, said her family would be purchasing gold for the bride and the groom according to the tradition. “We have already done half the gold shopping. At the maximum, we can go for 18 caret gold as gift for our relatives to suit our budget, but we will not be compromising on gold quality for the bride and the groom,” Ankita said.

Bullion traders said the reason for surging gold price over the past few days was tension between US and Iran. City-based economist DM Diwakar also cited tension in the Middle East as the reason behind rise in gold prices at present. “People in India are investing more in gold than in share market because of negative growth rate; hence, the demand for the yellow metal is also leading to increase in its price. Such trend has become more visible after demonetisation. Weak rupee has also made gold expensive at present,” he said.

56,['8/01/2020'],Rupee depreciation to help IT cos in a seasonally weak quarter,"Chennai: A seasonally soft quarter for Information Technology (IT) companies with increased shut-down days is likely to see further weakness due to segment-specific challenges in Banking and Financial Services (BFS) and retail verticals. Research firms expect an average 0.5%-2% constant currency (CC) sequential revenue growth for the top-tier IT players in the period- compared to around 1.5%-3% growth they typically post in December quarters in previous years. Weak tech spends by BFS firms and volatility in discretionary spends by disruption-hit retail sector is likely to bring moderation in revenue growth for IT players during October-December, while depreciation of rupee will benefit profitability, analysts estimate. “While top-tier IT players like TCS typically register 1.5%-1.6% CC sequential growth in the third quarter (Oct-Dec), we expect them to grow revenue at around 0.6% in December 2019,” Kuldeep Koul, research analyst at ICICI Securities, told TOI.ICICI Securities expects Tech Mahindra to grow the fastest at around 3% Q-o-Q and growth to be sluggish at TCS and Infosys. Analysts at Edelweiss Securities estimate top five IT players — Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL, TCS and Wipro — to report revenue growth in the range of 1.6%–4.1% quarter-on-quarter in CC terms.Despite slowing revenue growth, the deprecation of the rupee against global currencies is expected to help profitability in the quarter. “INR depreciation along with cross currency tailwinds in the quarter will help margins by an average 20-25 basis points (bps) (100 basis points= 1%) for most companies in our coverage,” ICICI Securities’ Koul added. However, factors pulling down profitability, such as high on-site costs and transition costs of large deals, will continue to impact the sector. The net impact on profits will depend on company-specific utilisation rates and deal wins in the quarter, analysts said.“Margin recovery, while aided by weak INR, could be partially offset by impact of furloughs,” researchers at Edelweiss said, anticipating a 20–35 bps bump in margins on account of currency movements. Major currencies such as the GBP, Euro, and Australan Dollar all appreciated in the range of 2-6% in the Oct-Dec period, macro data shows. Industry trackers are watching for management commentary on BFSI and retail, the sizes and tenures of digital deal wins, and commentary on overall geo-political factors. “We have seen multiple deal announcements by companies during this quarter, which is a positive as far as future demand is concerned,” Koul said.Demand outlook for calendar year 2020 may feel heat from the US elections, Kawaljeet Saluja, research analyst at Kotak Institutional Equities, said in a note. “During the run-up to elections, clients could be wary of signing large outsourcing deals with offshore providers that entail significant rebadging of onsite workforce, leading to delays in deal closures,” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-depreciation-to-help-it-cos-in-a-seasonally-weak-quarter/articleshow/73145560.cms

PATNA: Altogether 20 artisans from across the state were honoured for their excellence in handicrafts by state industries minister Shyam Rajak on Tuesday. Madhubani painting, tikuli art, jute art, terracotta handicrafts and samples of different other forms of art and crafts were taken for the selection of winners for 2016-17.

The winners received Rs 23,000 each. “The winners of state handicrafts award for 2017-18 will get Rs 50,000 each,” Rajak said.

Congratulating city-based Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan (UMSAS) for promoting indigenous art forms of the state, the minister said, “UMSAS started handling the responsibility of handicrafts in 2014. Since then, the state has received five gold medals at the international business fair, which is organised in New Delhi every year.”

The minister also urged UMSAS to set up its counters at Patna airport. “Bihar is known for its handicrafts, especially Madhubani paintings, which have made a mark in the world. I want people from outside Bihar to understand different forms of handicrafts,” he said.

UMSAS director Ashok Kumar Sinha said the amount of talent the artisans of the state have is a source of inspiration. “They just need to support,” Sinha added.

Sita Devi, who was felicitated for her talent in handicrafts in 1984, said, “Women living in rural as well as urban areas have gradually started understanding the importance of art and culture. They are learning how to display their talents.”

Rashmi Singh, who received an award in papier-mâché, said, “I was interested in papier-mâché art since childhood. With constant support of my parents, I made a career in this field.”

Vishuddhanand Mishra, who received an award in Manjusha art, said, “My work gives me real happiness. I am very happy after receiving the award.”

Students of Oxford Nursery and Primary School in Somarasampettai dressed in traditional attires

TRICHY: It wasn’t a usual day for children in Oxford Nursery and Primary School in Somarasampettai on Tuesday when schools reopened after a gap of more than 10 days.

Unlike other days, children turn up in traditional attire wearing ‘veshti’ and colourful shirts instead of the usual uniforms. While boys wore ‘veshti’, girls donned the traditional ‘pavadai sattai’ (skirt shirt) to come to the school. Teachers too came wearing the traditional attire. The school said that the objective was to make the students aware of traditional attire. A photography session was held followed by an orientation to the children on the purpose of such a celebration.

‘Veshti day’ announced by UNESCO is celebrated every year on January 6. As it was a closed holiday on Monday, we chose to celebrate it on Tuesday, said Raveena Mohanraj, correspondent of the school. We wanted to educate children on the traditional weavers of our country, she said.

S Prajan of class IV from the school found the ‘veshti’ comfortable than trousers. He wished if he could come to school wearing ‘veshti’ on a daily-basis. “I didn’t know about the weavers and wish to visit them to see how ‘veshtis’are made,” said Prajan.

S Santosh Kumar from class III said that he found it a bit time consuming to wear ‘veshti’and a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, but became used to it after wearing it through the day.

Block education officer K Marudhanayagam said that many of the schools had planned such events but postponed it due to distribution of books on the reopening day. He said that he will ask other schools to also sensitize children on the traditional attire.

PORVORIM: In a critical reaction, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said the governor’s speech in the House on Tuesday had no mention about how the state will come out from the financial crisis it is in.

Kamat told reporters that listening to the governor it appeared that there was no actual reality in his speech.

The state is going through a financial crisis, but there is no mention of it in the speech, he said. “We always say that the state is going through a financial crisis. Actually it appears that there is a financial emergency,” Kamat said.

To further highlight the state’s financial condition, Kamat said that the governor spoke about how much money was disbursed through the Laadli Laxmi scheme when girls who wed in 2018 and 2019 were yet to receive the money. “We are in 2020 and this is the financial position of the state,” he said.

The governor in his speech said that 65,724 beneficiaries have availed of the Laadli Laxmi. Under the social welfare scheme the government gives the newly married girl Rs 1 lakh.

He poked holes in the governor’s statement that the safety and security of tourists, women and children were the topmost priority of his government, and said that the recent incident wherein an impersonator met Goa ministers saying he was a UP minister pointed to the contrary.

“When such incident takes place there is always a question in the mind about the security,” he said.

Reacting to the governor saying that the government was committed to restarting mining in the second half of the year, Kamat said, “We have mentioned in the assembly to bring in an amendment to the MMRD Act or bring in an ordinance to restart mining, but what we are hearing is just assurances. There is no progress in the mining issue.”

CHENNAI: Sangam-era artefacts excavated at Keeladi and Odisha’s famed sand sculptures will greet visitors at the 43rd Chennai Book Fair to be held at YMCA ground in Nandanam from January 9 to 21.

The Booksellers and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI), with help from the archaeology department, has built a special auditorium for visitors to view the artefacts excavated from Keeladi in Sivaganga. “We have an exhibition at Madurai displaying Keeladi artefacts. A major collection of artefacts from that exhibition will be displayed at the bookfair,” said T Udhayachandran, commissioner of archaeology, Tamil Nadu . Replicas of some of the critical items which cannot be transported will be made.

“To see the artefacts one has to travel to Madurai. We are giving an opportunity to Chennaiites at the book fair to witness the Sangam-era artefacts,” he said.

The auditorium will also have virtual reality gears where visitors will get a feel of walking through the excavation site. Sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik will create a sand sculpture of Tamil saint-poet Thiruvalluvar at the entrance of the venue.

Two crore books will be on display at the fair. There will be more than 750 stalls.

“Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami would inaugurate the fair on January 9,” said R S Shanmugam, president of BAPASI. Publishers and booksellers have announced a 10% discount for all books at the fair.

“We have distributed five lakh free tickets to schools in and around Chennai to attract children to the fair. Last year, we had more than 20 lakh visitors and we expect more than 40 lakh visitors this year,” said BAPASI secretary S K Murugan.

The book fair will also have an 800sqft resting area.

“To connect writers, readers and publishers, BAPASI will hold an event called ‘Eluthalar Mutram’ (Writers Courtyard) where famous writers will introduce their books,” he said.

There will be oratory, drawing and quiz competitions for students. Short films and documentaries having social themes will be screened in an auditorium arranged separately for the purpose.

Puneet Sharma (File photo)

MUMBAI: Tata Capital ’s CFO Puneet Sharma has resigned after more than a decade-long stint with the financial services arm of the Tata Group. The resignation comes around the time when the company’s housing finance unit is raising Rs 2,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

Tata Capital has seen a string of exits from its management team in recent times and Sharma, who was present at the NCD launch press conference of Tata Capital Housing Finance on Monday, is the latest one to put in his papers. In August 2018, Govind Sankaranarayanan resigned from the COO position at Tata Capital.

Sharma could not be reached for a comment. He joined Tata Capital in 2008 after working with Citibank, Boston Consulting and KPMG India. Tata Capital declined to comment on the report.

Sources attributed the exits to differences of opinion with MD and CEO Rajiv Sabharwal, who joined Tata Capital in January 2018 from ICICI Bank. Variation in approach and the style of functioning are among the other, the sources added.

Sabharwal, said the sources, has hired at least a dozen people from the organizations where he had worked, before moving to Tata Capital. This, they said, has not gone down well with long-timers in the system. Some of the recent recruits to Tata Capital’s leadership team include Kusal Roy, MD of Tata Capital Financial Services who was hired from ICICI Bank in March 2018, and Anil Kaul, MD of Tata Capital Housing Finance who too was tapped from ICICI Bank in July 2018.

Tata Capital Housing Finance’s Rs 2,000-crore NCD issue will close on January 17. This is the company’s first public NCD offering through which it plans to raise at least 40% of the total amount from retail investors. On Tuesday, the opening day, it raised Rs 1,940 crore.

Students from #Left parties wanted to cancel admission process in #JNU.”The video went viral with Prasar Bharati News Services tweeting it, followed by BJP functionaries like Chetan Bragta, IT head and convenor of Himachal BJP, national IT cell head Amit Malviya and BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua.However, Altnews, which assesses fake news, disclosed on Monday, “The man in the red jacket is ABVP member Sharvender Kumar, a third-year PhD student at Centre for West Asian Studies, School of International Studies in JNU. His identity was confirmed to Alt News by four JNU students, two of whom are from SIS.” Apparently, Kumar was thrashing fellow SIS student Vivek Pandey on the school lawns.TOI asked Durgesh Kumar, president of JNU’s ABVP unit, whether Sharvender was an outfit member. Durgesh Kumar protested that “no ABVP member has indulged in any violence” but when it was pointed out that Sharvender could be seen in the company of ABVP activists wearing the outfit’s name card, he accepted that he was indeed a member of the RSS-linked student group and his junior in West Asian Studies. “Why he is seen beating up someone, I don’t know,” the unit president claimed.VC M Jagadesh Kumar, when asked why he had retweeted a video with the false accusation, said, “I also retweet from the MHRD handle and these are government-run twitter handles."" The VC added that investigation would help identify those involved in Sunday’s violence.In Video: Video fact check leaves ABVP red-faced as JNU attackers identified as RSS-affiliate’s members",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73147960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-530468,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/leftist-attacker-an-abvp-member/articleshow/73146703.cms

65,['8/01/2020'],High Court stays single judge order against Tamil university vice-chancellor posting,"This story is from January 8, 2020

IN MIDST OF A ROW

MADURAI: A division bench of the Madras high court has granted interim stay on a single judge order which set aside a government order (GO) that appointed G Balasubramanian as the vice-chancellor (VC) of Tamil University at Thanjavur .

Balasubramaniam, in his petition stated that he was appointed as the VC of the university on October 5, 2018. A candidate K Ravindran who applied for the post of VC filed a petition before the high court Madurai bench challenging the GO on ground that he did not possess the required qualification in conducting not less than one international level event as per clause 5 of the eligibility criteria.

Balasubramaniam stated that Ravindran also raised another ground that the senate nominee and syndicate nominee of the search committee who were holding positions earlier in the university are ineligible to be members of the search committee as per provisions of the UGC regulation and as per Section 12 of the Tamil University Act, 1982.

He said that the single judge had allowed the petition and quashed the GO appointing him as VC on December 20, 2019, citing that the senate and syndicate nominee of the search committee were earlier holding positions as syndicate member and VC of the university by misinterpreting Section 12 (2) of the Act.

The appellant submitted that Section 12 of the Act states that “The person nominated shall not be a member of any of the authorities of the university or shall not be connected with the university or any college or any recognised institution of the university.” He cited that the word ‘shall be’ only denotes ‘at present’. He further submitted that the senate and syndicate nominees of the search committee are no way connected with the university at present.

He noted that though Ravindran was well aware of the earlier positions held by the search committee members, he submitted his application before the same committee and merely because he was not selected, he cannot question the constitution of the search committee.

Hence, the appellant filed an appeal before the high court Madurai bench seeking to grant interim stay on the single judge order. When the appeal was heard on Tuesday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran granted interim stay and adjourned the case to January 10 for further hearing.

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday asked the officials of agriculture and building construction departments to ensure immediate renovation of Purnia’s famous Gulab Bagh Mandi, which is the state’s biggest grain market.

Nitish was holding a joint review meeting with the officials and elected peoples’ representatives of Purnia, Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj at Purnia collectorate as part of his ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali’ Yatra. He also asked the officials to conduct a fresh survey of public wells in Araria district before taking up their renovation work.

“As soon as I drew attention of the CM towards the dilapidated condition of roads, drains and buildings in the famous Gulab Bagh Mandi, the CM turned towards the government officials and asked the reasons behind not taking up the renovation work,” BJP’s Purnia MLA Vijay Kumar Khemka told TOI over phone on Tuesday.

“The CM asked a senior official of the building construction department in Patna through videoconferencing as to why the renovation work of Gulab Bagh Mandi has so far not been taken up despite a detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the agriculture department,” Khemka said.

Earlier, Khemka, while speaking in the review meeting, informed the CM that the agriculture department had approved a DPR of Rs15 crore for renovation of the famous mandi. The BCD has to execute the renovation work. But the matter is pending due to lack of coordination between the two departments.

Spread over an area of 68 acres, Gulab Bagh Mandi is facing a lot of problems due to its dilapidated roads, drains and ruined building, Khemka said, adding he had also raised this issue in the assembly in 2016 and at a previous review meeting of the CM in 2018. Reviewing the developmental works in Katihar, the CM asked the officials to take necessary steps to promote organic farming in different blocks of the district. “Katihar should be included in the list of 12 those districts where government has planned to promote organic farming,” the CM said at the meeting. “I urged the CM to upgrade Korha block headquarters as a subdivision and also open a degree college there,” Congress MLA Punam Paswan told TOI over phone.

Earlier in the day, Nitish, accompanied by several ministers and MLAs, visited Routara village under Korha block in Katihar district and Rupaspur Khagha panchayat in Purnia district and inspected several schemes being executed under the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan.

Hyderabad: As part of reaching out to households across the state to explain the Centre’s stand on Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, Telangana BJP has decided to cover at least 50 lakh population. The mass contact programme, which will be taken up from January 8, will continue till January 15.

Booth-wise members would visit each household in the villages and mandals, while the state-level leaders would interact with prominent citizens.

BJP activists would distribute pamphlets to family members in the households and explain to them on how National Population Register is a regular process and CAA is not against any particular community.

Central leaders from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Muralidhar Rao and Ram Madhav are already taking part in seminars and addressing various fora on CAA and NRC. Union junior minister for home G Kishan Reddy undertook an yatra on the issue.

Sources said the state BJP unit is also keen to win over the hearts of people by reaching out to them ahead of the municipal elections and expose the failures of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti government.

Meanwhile, BJP state president K Laxman met Union tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Tuesday and demanded that the Centre declare Sammaka-Sarakka jatara as a national festival.

Former Telangana TDP leader Motkupalli Narasimhulu joined BJP in the presence of BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi on Tuesday.

Chennai: With several parts of North India reeling under the chill weather, most retail players have seen the sales of winter wear jump by 15%-20% year-on-year in most cities.

Puma for e.g. has seen a 40% growth in winter sale in the north of the country. “A part of this is a result of rising sales of jackets and sweatshirts,” Abhishek Ganguly, MD, Puma India said.

Vineet Jain, head, north zone, Big Bazaar and Future Group seconds the thought. “Over the last two weekends, we are able to sell at retail prices while last winter we had begun discounting at around this time. Hence, we are seeing better margins on a like-to-like basis,” said Jain.

Harkirat Singh, MD, Aero Club (the makers and traders of brand Woodland), said that the last fortnight saw 15%-20% jump in sales compared to previous winter season. “Winter apparel is driving sales in North India from December, a welcome change from subdued consumer sentiments that prevailed earlier in 2019. Jackets and sweatshirts are seeing a demand. Fortunately for us, winter accounts for 65% of our sale,” he added

JP Shukla of tier-2 town focused ‘1-India Family Mart’ added that even with the onset of year-end sale, sentiments were down until December 15. “With increased demand for winter wear, we are running out of stock and are sourcing jackets from other neighbouring cities,” he added.

It is not just the brick and mortar shops that are experiencing the trend. E-commerce players like Myntra have also seen a sale of over 4 lakh jackets being sold in just 3 days — Dec 22 to Dec 25.

72,['8/01/2020'],Met predicts light showers in Bihar for two days from Wednesday,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday issued a forecast for scattered rainfall across the state on Wednesday and Thursday. The rain , however, is expected to be light in intensity.

An official at Patna Meteorological Centre attributed the showers to a western disturbance, the weather systems originating from Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfall in north-western Indian subcontinent.

“A western disturbance approaching Bihar through Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh is expected to cause light intensity rain across the state on January 8 and 9,” the official said.

Private weather agency Skymetweather also reported on Tuesday that scattered rain and thundershower activities are expected to begin in eastern parts of Madya Pradesh by Wednesday afternoon, which will gradually start affecting Bihar and Jharkhand.

“We expect rain and thundershower activities to lash eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand on January 8 and 9. In Bihar, the weather is expected to become dry from January 10,” the Skymet report stated.

As far as mercury readings during the rainy spell are concerned, weathermen have claimed that while night temperature may increase slightly, the day temperature may plunge by a few notches owing to the cloud cover.

The minimum temperature in Patna on Tuesday was recorded at 9.2 degrees C, which was at par with normal for the day. The minimum temperature readings at Gaya, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Chhapra and Forbesganj were recorded at 8, 9, 10.7, 7.1, 10.5 and 10.0 degrees C, respectively.

“The minimum temperature is likely to increase slightly at most places in the state over the next two days, but it will again plunge by a few notches after the cloud cover clears. Apart from plunge in temperature, dense fog cover is also expected in the early morning hours at most places in the state,” the weather official said.

The meteorologists are of the view that the peak winter period will start departing henceforth, even though cold conditions will continue for a few more weeks. “The days have started getting longer from December 28 and the solar rays have also started falling perpendicular along the equator. Hence, peak winter season will gradually depart,” the official at Patna Meteorological Centre said.

The four convicts of the Nirbhaya gang rape case in Delhi will be hanged to death with ‘Manila’ ropes prepared... Read More

PATNA: The four convicts of the Nirbhaya gang rape case in Delhi will be hanged to death with ‘Manila’ ropes prepared by the inmates of Buxar central jail , sources in the prison department said on Tuesday.

The Buxar jail has already supplied 10 such ropes to Tihar jail where the four convicts — Mukesh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh alias Akshay Thakur (31) -- are lodged and to be hanged on January 22. The ropes were supplied to Tihar jail authorities in December last year on the directive of the prison directorate in Patna.

Buxar jail superintendent Vijay Kumar Arora said he can’t share much information with the media as it is a sensitive issue. “What all I can say at this stage is that the hanging ropes made by the jail inmates were supplied to the authorities concerned much earlier,” he said.

Arora said the Buxar jail inmates have the expertise in making the wax-coated ‘Manila’ rope with 7200 threads meant for the hanging of those sentenced to death. A 16 feet rope costs around Rs2,120. “The rope can easily withstand the tension and pressure caused by the fall of a person weighting up to 150kg,” a senior jail official said.

Sources said the state prison directorate was told about the appropriate height and weight of all the four convicts at the time of placing demand for supply of the ropes in the first week of December last year. The length of a ‘Manila’ rope is 1.6 times more than the height of the convict and its thickness is proportionate to the convict’s weight, sources said.

Last time, the hanging ropes were provided to Tihar jail for the hanging of Afzal Guru on February 9, 2013. He was a convict in the 2001 Parliament attack case.

Earlier, the rope was supplied from Buxar jail in 2004 for the hanging of rape convict Dhananjay Chatterjee at Alipore jail following his conviction in a rape-cum-murder case. The prison has a history of making ‘Manila’ ropes since 1930.

Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended on the native village of Akshay Thakur in Aurangad district. The family members of Akshay, a resident of Lahangkarma village under Tandwa police station area in Aurangabad, are still hopeful of getting reprieve from the court. Akshay’s wife Punita Devi said, “Nirbhaya ko insaaf milna chahiye lekin kisi ke pariwar ko ujad kar nahi (Justice should be done with Nirbhaya but not at the cost of anybody’s family).”

Akshay’s mother Malti Devi said, “Hume ummid abhi bhi hai (I still have a ray of hope).” A number of residents thronged Akshay’s house soon after the death warrants were issued by the court against the four convicts on Tuesday.

74,['8/01/2020'],"No need to be precise and slow, be ‘roughly’ right &amp; fast","This story is from January 8, 2020

By M Muneer

Most early stage career seekers tend to follow the path of their seniors since that is what their peers and family expect them to do. So, they follow the crowd. Succumbing to the social pressure to do what is expected of them, they do not have a successful career strategy at all.

The essence of strategy is to have a differentiated value proposition and, even in a transient advantage era, the differentiation is key to success. The disruptive world of today has invalidated the two major assumptions of strategy that industry is everything, and competitive advantage once identified is sustainable. When advantages are transient, strategy needs a new playbook, according to US management scholar Rita McGrath.

Management structures that directed resources and talent to strategic business units were associated with high performance. The talent of tomorrow will need the ability to quickly disengage and engage with new things, be able to shift continually, be fast & roughly right instead of precise & slow, and be disconfirmation-seeking, among other things.

Here are some strategies to become career superstars:

Go where there is less competition: I know a few Indians who learnt Japanese and migrated to Japan and built a successful career there. Very few foreigners speak native languages fluently and enterprises are embracing diversity in a big way to drive innovation in the transient advantage era. The essence of a successful strategy is to redraw competition and this is one way to succeed in your career. One can also think of entering an industry like pharma, which is not preferred by most MBAs because of low starting salaries. Find out where competition is less and map skills and interests with those industries or countries. White space-mapping and even blue-ocean strategy can be applied to personal career assessments.

Find a job where you can add unique value: For instance, if you are a doctor and then do MBA, you will add tremendous value to the healthcare industry. Or, if you are a data analyst with human resource specialisation, you could guide organisations in managing their workforce in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). If you have experience in a particular industry, like transportation with operations management tools, you will have unique value to offer to a variety of businesses where process efficiency is key.

Find your own path: Shed the herd mentality. Just because your peers and friends are working a 9-to-5 job doesn’t mean you have to follow suit. If you want to start your own business, then think about what you’d need to excel as an entrepreneur instead of doing a job. You can probably create a disruptive model and unseat many existing business models. Plan for it even when you are employed in a place so you can find your path one way or the other. My partner started a deep tech startup at the age of 55.

Do a risk-return analysis: You can take a riskier strategy, such as joining a startup. If you had jumped into Flipkart in its early days, your risks were huge and of course the returns too when it was acquired by Walmart. Just as there is a trade-off between risk and return in the financial markets, there is one for careers as well. Playing it safe may be — and certainly feels — comfortable. But if you really want to accelerate your career, implementing a higher variance, a riskier strategy may be the way to go.

During the course of your career, you may want to choose one of these four strategic options and at appropriate career junctures, depending on the opportunities and competitive positions. The risk you take is not that risky as you might imagine. If things don’t work out, you can always do what you were going to do in the first place.

Over the course of a 30-40-year career, taking prudent risks in early stages seems very sensible. And who knows, you may drive an important function at a huge, rapidly growing firm — much earlier than even you expect. Career success is not measured by where you end up in the first half of your career. What matters is where you are in the second half. Your investment in the first half matters most for that. Just as in a movie, the second half decides whether it is a success or failure.

75,['8/01/2020'],ChrysCapital exits IPCA Labs in Rs 560cr deal,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Rupali Mukherjee | TNN

Mumbai: Private equity major ChrysCapital has exited mid-size drug firm IPCA Labs , offloading its entire stake to 10 mutual funds, for around Rs 560 crore.

The PE firm offloaded its 4% stake in the company recently, sources said, mopping up returns of nearly 2.5x on its investment. The firm had invested Rs 245 crore spread over two lots — in 2014 and 2016.

ChrysCapital, the largest homegrown PE fund, has approximately $4 billion of assets under management (AUM) across eight funds, with marquee investors including sovereign wealth funds, endowments and pension funds.

ChrysCapital officials were not available for comments, while IPCA Labs did not respond to a email till the time of going to press. The firm has invested in over 80 companies, with strategic mid-to-high teens’ stake in companies like Intas Pharma, Mankind Pharma , GVK Bio and Curatio. At present, ChrysCapital has half a billion invested in healthcare firms, with a bulk — around $320 million in Mankind alone.

The firm picked up around 10% stake in Mankind in 2018. This is the second time ChrysCapital invested in the Delhi-based drug firm, after exiting its 11% stake in 2015 to Capital International for $214 million, with a tenfold return in seven years.

The PE firm has mopped up returns of around 5x on the investments made in healthcare, making it one of the best bets for investors.

Interestingly, 2018 was one of the best years for exits in the last decade, with 265 exits valued at nearly $33 billion, signalling investor confidence in the Indian market, says Bain & Co’s, ‘2019 India Private Equity Report’. A few large exits dominated in 2018, with the top 10 exits accounting for 70% of total exit value. Nearly half of last year’s exit value resulted from the $16 billion sale of Flipkart to Walmart. Apart from Flipkart, these included Intelenet Global Services (Blackstone), GlobalLogic (Apax), Star Health and Allied Insurance (multiple funds) and Vishal Retail (TPG).

Exits increased across sectors, with the primary contributors to exit values being consumer tech, IT, ITES, and BFSI.

The public market remained the most preferred mode for exits—though there was a spike in strategic exits, primarily driven by consumer tech. Over the last five years, funds have made reasonable returns across most sectors, with consumer tech, IT/enterprise tech and BFSI having the highest multiples on invested capital.

Further, the industry had an excellent run at raising funds to the tune of $714 billion from investors during the year, the third-largest amount on record, bringing the total capital raised since 2014 to $3.7 trillion, it adds.

Lucknow: Not only friends and family in Lucknow but social activists and acquaintances in Delhi also had tears of happiness in their eyes when social activist and theatre artist Deepak Kabir was granted bail on Tuesday evening.

Kabir’s wife Veena Rana was at Constitution Club in Delhi to attend a solidarity meet in defence of human rights activists and people of Uttar Pradesh when she got the news that Kabir has been granted bail.

“My immediate aim was to get bail for him. I was speaking in Delhi on behalf of all the people who were arrested by UP police for protesting against new citizenship law. As soon as I got the news of his bail and shared it with the audience, people could not stop clapping. Ek sukoon sa lag raha hai ab (Feeling a bit relaxed now),” said Veena.

She immediately booked a flight to Lucknow to complete paper work for Kabir’s release.

Kabir, 48, was arrested on December 20 when he went to police station to enquire about some people who went missing after the anti-CAA agitation on December 19.

According to police, Kabir was arrested on charges of rioting and preventing public servants from performing their duty.

While Rana was sharing her happiness with Kabir’s supporters in Delhi, the real joy was for his 15-year-old son Sufi Kabir, who is anxiously waiting for his father to return.

“I know he is a strong man but we were worried about him because of the pain and injuries he sustained in jail. The moment the court’s decision came in, my phone did not stop ringing. We only hope that everything will be fine once he returns,” Sufi said.

Representative image

PATNA: After a brief respite, the air quality in the state capital slipped from ‘moderate’ to ‘very poor’ category in the last 24 hours. Experts said it may further deteriorate due to low wind velocity and fall in temperature, as predicted by the Air Quality Early Warning System of the Union ministry of earth sciences.

Track the pollution level in your city

According to figures released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Patna increased from 115 on Monday to 323 on Tuesday, while the AQI of Muzaffarpur stood at 394, which was the highest in the country.

Among the 99 cities, Patna figured among top five polluted cities in India after Talcher, Varanasi and Kanpur. The AQI level at Gaya stood at 121, which falls in the ‘moderate’ category.

Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials stated that the overall AQI of 365 for Patna was the average recorded at the air quality monitoring stations at planetarium (400), BIT-Mesra, Patna (339), Eco Park (295) and SK Memorial Hall (257).

Ankita Jyoti, a senior programme officer of Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), told this newspaper on Tuesday that continuous fluctuation in weather conditions, including fall in temperature and high humidity are the major factors behind the rise in AQI.

“The wind velocity is good but it contains moisture, which creates thermal inversion in the atmosphere. Due to this inversion, the pollutant dispersion is very minimal,” she said and added: “The worsening of air quality in Muzaffarpur can be attributed to relatively calmer winds, which are not dispersing the pollutants.”

Pradhan Parth Sarth, the standing committee member of Bihar State Action Plan for Climate Change, said the air quality of Patna might improve under the influence of a western disturbance that is expected to impact the weather in Bihar on January 8 and 9. “The western disturbance will lead to strengthening of surface winds. Nevertheless, the air quality in Patna will remain poor to very poor till January-end,” he said.

PATNA: A free of cost online study centre , the first in any campus in the state, to help students do self-studies in leisure hours, is being developed at A N College here. Initially, the centre will be available only for students of the college. However, its services will be extended to poor students from other colleges on a normal charge in the near future.

“The online study centre, being developed with a financial assistance of Rs 3.25 crore from the state government in the humanities building of the college, will have 220 computers. The centre will start functioning from March this year,” said principal of A N College Dr S P Shahi.

Students enrolled in any class from Intermediate to postgraduate and vocational courses can avail the facility. The college has about 15,000 students enrolled in various courses.

Shahi said after assessment of the students’ response and their participation in this online self-study programme, the college will throw it open for poor students of other colleges in the evening hours, though with a minimal charge.

“Course materials of all subjects and references will be available online for students. However, there will be no provision for private chatting and misuse of the computer systems. A committee of senior teachers will manage the functioning of this study centre. The idea behind establishing online study centre is to provide a better option to students to use their leisure hours,” Shahi said.

He added that foundation stone for a multi-purpose building involving an expenditure of Rs 10 crore will also be laid in the college this month. “This building will have an auditorium with 540 seats and six conference rooms, each with seating capacities ranging between 100 and 150 students. The rooms will be equipped with modern facilities,” Shahi said.

Apart from its own functions, the auditorium and conference rooms will also be let out for other programmes. “Being the state capital, several academic, scientific and other programmes and meetings are regularly held here and letting out these venues inside the campus will help generate internal an annual revenue of around Rs 1 crore,” the principal said.

Shahi said altogether Rs 30 crore was received from the state government for these development projects, including a new boundary wall around the campus.

Atishi

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will be ready with its manifesto for the Delhi assembly elections by January 20 . A three-member committee, headed by party functionary Atishi, has been formed to prepare the manifesto, which will include AAP’s vision for the capital and Delhiites’ suggestions.

Atishi, AAP’s national spokesperson, was also in charge of the manifesto committee for the 2015 elections. The other members are Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah and former Jamshedpur MP Ajoy Kumar who had joined the party a few months ago. The polling is scheduled on February 8 and the result will be out on February 11.

While Atishi, an Oxford alumnus, is the key person behind the AAP government’s education policies, Shah, who had studied at Columbia University, has been part of the planning process of various policies. Kumar, a former IPS officer, is currently one of the national spokespersons.

“We will launch the manifesto between January 15 and 20. Many valuable suggestions, received during the town hall meetings and the door-to-door campaign, will be incorporated,” AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said on Tuesday.

The manifesto is likely to deal considerably with the issue of making Delhi clean. “It is the responsibility of the municipal corporations, run by BJP for the past 15 years, to make Delhi clean. But people are unhappy with sanitation services and waste management; they demand that AAP should take some steps,” Rai said.

Other important issues include cleaning the Yamuna, tackling pollution, providing 24X7 water, free bus rides for students, redesigning roads, improving public transport, and solving parking chaos and traffic congestion.

AAP has already said people will continue to get 200 units of electricity and 20,000 litre water per month free if it returns to power. While the free pilgrimage scheme and free bus rides for women will also be there, the free Wi-Fi connectivity will be expanded across the city.

Rai said over 30 lakh people had already got the government’s report card through the town halls, 600 mohalla sabhas and the door-to-door campaign.

The party plans to take it to 5 lakh more people thorugh around 60,000 volunteers in the next few days. “After completing the second phase of AAP’s election campaign on January 10, we will prepare the manifesto,” said Rai.

82,['8/01/2020'],Political parties gear up for electoral semis in Bihar,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Rajiv Ranjan Singh

PATNA: The political parties in Bihar are set to play an electoral semi-finals in April-May before the assembly elections due later this year. Altogether 29 seats in Bihar legislative council will fall vacant by May and elections will be held for altogether 17 seats as 12 will be nominated by the governor for the 75-member Upper House.

Two seats from the governor quota are already vacant after the resignation of former minister Pashupati Kumar Paras and JD(U) leader Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh in May last year following their election to the Lok Sabha from Hajipur and Munger, respectively.

Seventeen seats will fall vacant on May 6 while the rest 10 on May 23. Of the 17 members to be elected through biennial poll, four will come from the graduates’ constituency, another four from the teachers’ constituency and the rest nine from the Vidhan Sabha constituency.

The four graduates’ constituencies where biennial polls will be necessitated probably in April are Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga and Kosi. These seats will fall vacant as the term of Neeraj Kumar (JDU), Devesh Chandra Thakur (Independent), Dilip Kumar Choudhary (JDU) and N K Yadav (BJP) will expire on May 6.

Similarly, four seats from teachers’ constituencies to fall vacant are Patna, Tirhut, Darbhanga, and Saran as the term of Nawal Kishor Yadav (BJP), Sanjay Kumar Singh (CPI), Madan Mohan Jha (Congress) and Kedar Nath Pandey (CPI) will expire on May 6.

Out of the nine members from Vidhan Sabha constituency retiring on May 6, six are from JD(U) and three belong to its ally BJP. They are Council’s acting chairperson Haroon Rashid, Ashok Kumar Choudhary, Prashant Kumar Shahi, Satish Kumar, Sonelal Mehta, Hira Prasad Bind from JD(U) and Krishna Kumar Singh, Sanjay Prakash and Radha Mohan Sharma from BJP.

Moreover, another 10 members, who were nominated by the governor six years back and completing their term on May 23 are Ram Lakhan Ram ‘Raman’, Vijay Kumar Mishra, Rana Gangeshwar Singh, Javed Iqbal Ansari, Shiv Prasann Yadav, JD(U)’s chief whip Sanjay Kumar Singh alias Gandhiji, Ram Bachan Roy, Lallan Kumar Sarraf, Ranbir Nandan and Ram Chandra Bharti.

As the election for 17 seats are likely to be held in April, prospective candidates have started lobbying in their respective parties. Those seeking nomination against 12 seats from the governor quota have also started lobbying with the top leaders of the ruling JD(U), BJP and LJP.

“The 12 seats may be distributed among the JD(U), BJP and the LJP,” a senior BJP leader said.

“Our party’s top leaders will decide as to who will get nomination from the governor’s quota. It is my second term in the council. I got enough honour and opportunity from my party. I am a dedicated soldier of JD(U) and will do whatever the party leaders ask me to do,” JD(U) chief whip Sanjay Kumar Singh told TOI on Tuesday.

Though the Election Commission is yet to announce the schedule for the biennial polls in the graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies, prospective candidates have already begun hectic campaigning in their respective constituencies.

State's information and public relations minister Neeraj Kumar, who was elected from Patna graduates’ constituency last time, have already started holding public meetings in his area in the hope of getting the party’s symbol. “In the recent months, I held more than 100 meetings in different villages and block level towns to seek vote in favour of the JD(U). Though the party has so far not declared its candidate for the Patna graduate seat, I have given a slogan to vote for JD(U) against the ‘politics of dynasty’ and ‘politics of amassing illegal assets’,” Neeraj told TOI on Tuesday.

Women selecting gold jewellery for marriage ceremony at a shop in Patna

PATNA: With the prices of gold going up sharply, Patnaites are left with no choice but to buy other metals and stones that are less expensive.

According to some city jewellers, platinum is in vogue among young people as they consider it classy.

“There is not much difference in the prices of gold and platinum jewellery. Hence, young couples prefer platinum rings, bracelets and love bands of similar designs. They also buy Turkish jewellery because it is lighter and cheaper,” Saket Keshri, the owner of a jewellery shop in Hathua Market, told this newspaper on Tuesday.

Middle-aged and elderly people, however, usually purchase gold jewellery, despite its high rate, because they consider it a “long-term investment”. The manager of a jewellery store on Boring Road, Pawan Kumar, pointed out, “Gold, according to many, symbolizes tradition. So, whether it is expensive or cheap, they will buy it.”

Pawan added, “The young generation has a completely different taste when it comes to buying jewellery. They go for everything that is in trend — from rubies to emeralds and sapphires.”

Soon-to-be bride, Priya Kumar , is planning to buy a Turkish necklace set for her wedding. The Saguna Mor resident said, “My mother wanted me to wear a heavy gold set on my wedding day, but I have decided to purchase a Turkish set as it is trendy.”

Another bride-to-be, Poornima Verma, who will tie the knot in February, is a huge fan of platinum and sapphire. “Platinum jewellery looks elegant and classy. That is what I am planning to buy,” she said.

A senior VIB officer said the amount recovered from the possession of the two executive engineers was the highest ever cash seized by the trap teams from any public servant in recent times. The bureau also registered six disproportionate assets (DA) cases against corrupt government employees.

Sources said a DA case of Rs5.16 crore was lodged against executive engineer Suresh Prasad Singh and his wife Shanti Singh following the recovery of Rs2.36 crore cash from his West Patel Nagar house in Patna on June 8, 2019. Singh is still languishing in the Beur central jail.

Surprisingly, seven cases of abuse of official position were reported to the bureau in 2019. The most important among them was related to Ram Kishore Singh, a member of the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC), who with an accomplice Parmeswar Rai had allegedly demanded the bribe in lieu of helping a candidate in the interview.

Moreover, immovable property worth Rs11.64 crore belonging to seven corrupt officials was confiscated under the provisions of Bihar Special Courts Rule 2009 in 2019. In addition, altogether 465 complaints were disposed of by the investigating officers last year.

CHENNAI: Residents in and around the Anna Nagar Tower Park area will soon get a yoga centre and a gym for women.

Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has floated tenders to construct a gym for women as well as a completely covered yoga centre at the cost of Rs 11.8 lakh. This falls in ward 100 of zone 8. The funds have been made available from the local Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA)’s funds for development of his constituency.

Across the city and extended areas, there are many parks where gym equipment has been provided by the GCC. These are popular among citizens who either don’t have the time, inclination or financial capability to pay fees for a gym in the city. Usually the equipment provided in such parks include exercise cycle and adjustable bench press among others.

“There has been a huge demand from nearby residents to install gym equipment in the park,” said a senior GCC official in Anna Nagar zone.

The gym would be constructed in a way where it would be open at the top but covered on the sides, with adequate green cover for women patrons. The gym would have at least six equipment, the official said.

As for the yoga centre, the official said there had been requests to construct it in a manner so that it could be used during monsoon as well. “We will have a GI sheet roofing,” he said.

Officials said they have many proposals for adding amenities in parks as there is a huge rush between 8am and 11am and after 4pm of local residents.

“However, we have been unable to execute the work due to shortage of funds,” the official said.

89,['8/01/2020'],Chennai: ‘Probe report into graft complaint against Velumani ready’,"This story is from January 8, 2020

S P Velumani

CHENNAI: The preliminary inquiry into corruption complaints against local administration minister S P Velumani is over and a report has been submitted too, government informed the Madras high court on Tuesday.

Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha directed the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) to produce the preliminary inquiry report along with the case files by January 23.

The matter relates to the corruption complaints lodged with DVAC by the DMK and anti-graft organisation Arappor Iyakkam, alleging illegalities in awarding tenders of corporations. On Tuesday, state public prosecutor A Natarajan told the bench that the inquiry had been completed and a report submitted to the director of DVAC.

Earlier, senior advocate NR Elango, representing the DMK, submitted that the Prevention of Corruption Act does not mandate preliminary inquiry at all. However, the agency is claiming to be conducting the inquiry as per the DVAC manual. “The manual is nothing but various circulars issued by the state or the DVAC setting guidelines to conduct inquiries. But in no way the manual can be placed above the provisions of the CrPC,” Elango said.

This apart, as per the amendment made to the PC Act, only governor can order sanction to commence inquiry against a public servant. But in the present case, DVAC has obtained the sanction from the chief secretary, he added.

Arguing for Arappor Iyakkam, advocate V Suresh submitted that in view of involvement of a senior minister like Velumani the petitioner has no trust that any of the wings of the state government would conduct a fair probe. Pointing out that as per the PC Act the DVAC is bound to complete the preliminary inquiry within 4 months, Suresh said the state gave its concurrence for the probe on January 8, 2019 and the DVAC commenced it on January 21, 2019. It been almost a year but still they claim not to have completed the inquiry. DVAC cannot take cover under the preliminary inquiry, he added.

91,['8/01/2020'],Seven cops arrested after undertrial tries to shoot self inside courtroom,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Agra: Mainpuri police on Tuesday arrested seven policemen including a woman constable on charges of dereliction of duty and criminal conspiracy, a day after an accused in a triple murder case shot and injured himself with a countrymade pistol inside a local court room. The weapon was allegedly sneaked into the courtroom by the wife of the accused, Manish Yadav. She has also been arrested.

The seven arrested cops were released on bail later in the evening.

The incident took place barely a month after the brazen shootout inside a courtroom in Bijnor in which an alleged history-sheeter was shot while he was appearing in a murder case, by the son of a slain BSP leader. The incident has set the alarm bells ringing over security arrangements in UP’s district courts.

Talking to TOI, Mainpuri SP Ajay Kumar said that 10 policemen, including the seven arrested cops, had been suspended in connection with the incident. He said that the arrested cops were remanded to judicial custody today. “They are prima facie responsible for the incident as they all were directly involved in escorting and frisking of under trials, who had to appear before the additional district judge Tarun Kumar Singh’s court on Monday and remaining three were supervisory officers,” said the SP.

The arrested cops are constable Yogendra Chaudhary, who was on duty at Sadar lock up, from where the under trial had to come to the court room, constable Pradeep Raja, who had to escort him to the court, and five others, head constable Ramakant Upadhyaya, constable Satyaveer Singh, head constable LIU Vijay singh, constable LIU Dileep Kumar and woman constable Kusum Chahar, who were involved in checking and frisking at the main gate of the court.

The cops have been booked under Section 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 420 (cheating), and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC, said additional SP OP Singh. Beside these seven, inspector Mukesh Malik, in charge of court security, inspector Vijay Kumar Gautam and sub-inspector Ajay Pratap Singh, who were on duty at Sadar police station, have been suspended.

Manish’s maternal uncle, Vinod, who had got the weapon and bullets, however, managed to flee from the spot. The accused’s wife Seema had reportedly concealed the weapon inside her dress and had handed it over to her husband while he was entering the courtroom.

The court clerk, Devendra Gaur, who filed a complaint in the case, stated in the FIR that the incident took place around 3 pm on Monday, when three accused in the case, including Manish, were present inside the witness box. According to information, the judge was inside the court’s chamber that time.

The SP said that earlier Manish claimed that his brother-in-law Prince was behind the attack on him but preliminary inquiryrevealed that the latter was not even present in the court when the incident took place. Manish’s wife Seema was arrested by police from her parental house in Manikpur village on Monday night and she revealed the whole story behind this.

According to the SP, during interrogation, Manish told police that he had planned to frame his brother-in-law Prince in the case in an attempt to build pressure on his sister Rachna, who is the prime witness in the triple murder case, on advice of his lawyer. Police is inquiring about his claims, said the SP.

According to police, the accused Manish, in connivance with Kallu and Jitendra, had on October 9, 2012 shot dead his father Sukhram, stepmother Sushma Devi and brother Abhishek over a property dispute under Karhal police station area of the district. Manish along with Kallu and Jitendra were produced in the court for hearing.

Manish was booked by Kotwali police on Monday under various sections of the IPC along with 3/25/26 Arms Act. He was first taken to a district hospital for treatment and later referred to Saifai medical university hospital. His left foot got injured as bullet brushed past the calf muscles, said police.

93,['8/01/2020'],Mining in second half of year: Governor Satya Pal Malik,"This story is from January 8, 2020

PORVORIM: Governor Satya Pal Malik on Tuesday said that the Pramod Sawant-led government would do all it can to resume mining operations in the state in the second half of the year and to protect Goa’s interests in the Mhadei water diversion issue.

The governor said that the mining industry is a major revenue and employment generator for the state and that the “government is very optimistic about resuming mining operations in Goa during the ensuing season thereby rejuvenating state’s economy and lives of citizens”.

“My government has left no stone unturned to explore all possible ways and means of resumption of mining in Goa,” Malik said in his customary speech before the state assembly on the opening day of the year’s first session.

The governor said that the BJP-led state government was conscious of the public concerns over the Mhadei water diversion issue and would do all it can to protect Goa’s interests.

Malik began his speech by highlighting the contribution made by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar . He then lauded the role of security agencies, especially Goa police, in reducing crime and giving priority to the safety and security of tourists, women and children.

In his hour-long speech, Malik stressed on mining and Mhadei issues, which also saw a united opposition protesting in the House after the speaker refused to allow a discussion on the water diversion issue.

The Goa government has deliberated both issues with several Union ministers on numerous occasions and even submitted four representations to try and garner support for the resumption of mining operations.

The state government has suggested that amendments to the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987, wherein its implementation is sought to be prospective in nature, could help restart mining, Malik said.

Moving on to the Mhadei issue, Malik — who even met and raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi — attempted to quell allegations by the opposition that the Goa government has not shown urgency in resolving the concerns.

“My government is conscious about the Mhadei issue, which affects every Goan. Efforts of my government are to prevent water diversion outside the river basin,” Malik said.

The Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal was appointed in November 2010 and it gave its award on August 14, 2018.

Goa has requested for a clarification from the tribunal under Section 5(3) of the Interstate River Water Disputes Act, 1956. Goa has also filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court praying for review of the tribunal award besides filing necessary contempt proceedings before the Supreme Court.

95,['8/01/2020'],Selection of SEC set in motion as LG-CM tussle continues,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Puducherry: The ongoing tussle between lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi and Congress government headed by chief minister V Narayanasamy over the mode of selection of state election commissioner (SEC) appears to have tilted in favour of Bedi on Tuesday with the local administration secretariat placing advertisements in newspapers inviting applications from eligible candidates for appointment of SEC to conduct the local body polls in the Union territory.

Bedi and Narayanasamy, who have been on the loggerheads over several issues, earlier declared each other’s orders related to SEC appointment as ‘null and void’.

Bedi in an order dated December 20 last year declared that the appointment of retired IAS officer T M Balakrishnan as SEC by the local administration secretariat in July last year following recommendations by the Congress government as ‘null and void’.

Bedi’s action came after the Union home ministry endorsed her views and directed the government to select the SEC through a competitive and fair process inviting applications through an all India advertisement. Bedi also passed an order directing chief secretary Ashwani Kumar to comply with the ministry’s directions and initiate efforts to select SEC.

Reacting sharply to Bedi's action Narayanasamy passed an order on January 3 declaring Bedi’s December 20 order as ‘null and void’. He directed the chief secretary not to follow Bedi’s direction. He claimed that SEC, who was nominated after the legislative assembly passed a unanimous resolution, can be removed only through legislative action. He maintained that SEC will continue his work to hold local body polls.

Amidst growing tension between the two constitutional offices, the local administration secretariat on Tuesday issued an advertisement on January 7 inviting applications from eligible candidates for the post of SEC.

Under-secretary (local administration) Giddi Balaram said people, who served under the Union or state governments for not less than 25 years with knowledge and experience in conducting elections and aged less than 65 years can apply for the lone post.

The applications must reach the director, local administration department, No 16, Suffren Street, Puducherry 605 001 before February 6. The applicants can also send soft copies to email id: dirlad.pon@nic.in.

The development is largely seen as all-out attempts by the two constitutional offices to establish their supremacy and authority in the Union territory. It may be recalled that the Madras high court bench has reserved its judgement in an appeal filed by the Union home ministry against an order of the high court that declared that the lieutenant governor cannot run a parallel government and cannot interfere with the day-to-day affairs of the elected government.

New Delhi: With elections due in the city, pressure groups have already started pushing their demands. Traders under the umbrella of Confederation of All India Traders organised a rally in Ramlila Maidan on Wednesday. Among other demands like halting the sealing drive and due representation in the election tickets, curbs on online e-commerce companies featured prominently.

BC Bhartia, national president of CAIT, announced at the session that a “National Halla Bol” campaign will be launched from January 15 to February 15 under the leadership of CAIT. Praveen Khandelwal, the general secretary of CAIT, said that at the call of All India Mobile Retailers Association, an associate body of the CAIT, more than 20 lakh mobile stores were closed across the country.

“Thousands of Hall Bol rallies will be held in different cities and will demand the Union and state governments to compel e-commerce companies to fall in line to comply with the policy and the law,” Khandelwal said.

The traders’ body demanded that BJP should declare a trader as a candidate for the post of chief minister of Delhi. “With more than 15 lakh traders of Delhi, their employees and families, more than 40 lakh people will support the party. The support of seven crore traders from all over the country will also strengthen it. No government in Delhi can be formed without support of the trading community as it is one of the major vote banks,” he said.

Speaking on e-commerce companies, Khandelwal alleged that they are firmly engaged in hollowing out the roots of the Indian economy by committing massive tax evasion of GST.

Dilip Shanghvi, MD of India's most valuable drug firm Sun Pharmaceutical Industries , is now looking at new markets to fire the company's growth engine. The Gujarati businessman started his entrepreneurial journey from Kolkata with about Rs 10,000 nearly four decades ago. Today, he runs the world's fourth-largest specialty generics maker, generating revenues of over Rs 30,000 crore. Excerpts from an exclusive interview:

How is the economic slowdown affecting the sector in general, and Sun Pharma in particular?

The Indian pharma industry has registered good growth in the first half of the year, and Sun Pharma has also performed well. We have taken multiple initiatives to respond to the challenges being faced by the industry and continue to remain positive.

At a time when operating margins on generics have been impacted in the US due to increase in competition, what are the avenues identified for growth in the most lucrative market, which contributes around 35% to company's revenue?

We are continuing our focus on complex and value-added generics and expect to launch new products in areas with limited competition. At the same time, we have been making significant investments to build a portfolio of branded or specialty products for the US market.

We are currently marketing eight specialty products (Ilumya, Absorica, Bromsite, Xelpros, Yonsa, Levulan Kerastick, Odomzo & Cequa) in the US with focus on dermatology, oncology and ophthalmology. In H1FY20, our global specialty business contributed around 8% to our consolidated revenues ($2.3 billion). It is currently a small part, but we expect it to scale up over three-five years.

Markets like China and Japan have witnessed keen interest from domestic companies recently for growth. What is the company's strategy for these markets?

We expect China and Japan to become an increasingly important part of our future business. We are looking at partnering with leading pharmaceutical companies in China to introduce our specialty, differentiated and generic products. Earlier in the year, we partnered with China Medical System Holdings for both our specialty (Ilumya, Cequa) and generic products. We have also recently signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to introduce certain novel ready-to-use infusion oncology products in China. Japan is the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market and there is a lot of potential in the branded segment. We have a good basket of branded specialty products that can be introduced in Japan in future. Our subsidiary Pola Pharma's strong front-end and manufacturing capabilities give us the confidence that we will be able to serve the Japanese pharmaceutical market better in the coming years.

Are you a proponent of investing in core business, or like most conglomerates make unrelated bets?

We are very much focused on investing and strengthening our core business of pharmaceuticals.

Can you give us an update on allegations of financial irregularities and corporate governance lapses raised by a whistleblower?

At Sun, we remain committed to follow the highest levels of corporate governance. There were some perception issues that have been addressed. Our board has taken necessary steps to strengthen governance standards further. On the whistleblower query, we have provided whatever information Sebi has asked for and there is no further update.

Several companies have either incubated new ventures or acquired promising startups to give them edge. How has Sun Pharma addressed this?

Sun Pharma has picked up minority stakes of 18-20% in pharmaceutical research companies, Israeli-based Tarsius Pharma and US-based MedInstill in the past.

The figure for stillbirth cases in 2019 is five times the national and state average.Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) registered 1,070 stillbirths (death of a baby after 24 weeks of pregnancy and before birth), of which 628 were male and 442 female in 2019. Total number of births was 53,907. Thus, ratio of stillbirth is 19.84 per 1,000 births.In 2018, the civic body had registered 58,403 births and 495 stillbirths for a ratio of 8.47 per 1,000 births.As per National Health Policy’s report, stillbirth ratio of the country as well as the state was 4 per 1,000 births in 2017. The government had set a target to bring down stillbirths to single digit by 2025.Executive member of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Pinak Dande told TOI cases of stillbirth are not a reflection on city’s medical facilities. “Percentage of stillbirth might be high due to migratory labour class and poor people residing in city’s outskirts or in rural areas. It seems to be a social economic problem and not related to medical facilities,” he said.Deputy director (health) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said the government’s schemes for registering, monitoring pregnant women, and encouraging delivery only in hospitals is being implemented in a very effective manner. “The government has made a provision for Rs5,000 in three instalments for every pregnant woman. Free delivery facility is available in NMC and government-run hospitals. Stillbirth can be avoided if a single doctor and hospital are fixed for regular check-up and delivery. Need is to visit doctor immediately in case of pain or any problem. Also, pregnant woman should go for check up in given time period by doctors, and avoid social and customary practice of delivery at maternal places if there is a lack of proper medical facilities,” he said.Each of NMC’s Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC) covers 50,000 population in which ASHA workers have to register all pregnant women, monitor and ensure delivery at hospitals only. In case of delivery in NMC-run hospitals, all services are free and mother is given Rs600 for nutritious meals.Fortunately, city’s infant mortality rate (IMR, i.e. death of a child from day 0 to 1 year) continues to be low. In 2019, the civic body registered 335 cases of which 170 were male and 165 female, for a ratio of 6.2 per 1,000 births.In 2018, NMC recorded 305 infant mortality cases of which 115 were male and 150 female for a ratio of 5.2 per 1,000 births.As per National Health Policy, IMR of country was 33 per 1,000 births and state was 19 per 1,000 births in 2017. The central government had set target of 28 per 1,000 births for country in 2019. The state had set target IMR of 10 per 1,000 by 2030.NMC health and birth registration department under deputy municipal commissioner Ranjan Lade has improved registration of stillbirth and infant mortality in last couple of years. The department has made it mandatory for all hospitals to inform about these cases and also started to compare it with data collected from all crematoriums of the city.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73145901,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-251177,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stillbirth-cases-double-in-2019-ratio-5-times-national-state-avg/articleshow/73145901.cms
100,['8/01/2020'],Nagpur: Making Maha load-shedding free is my priority,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nitin Raut

NAGPUR: After taking over the reins of the energy portfolio in Mumbai on Tuesday, minister Nitin Raut has his task cut out. His immediate plan is to reduce transmission and distribution losses and make the state load-shedding free. The Congress MLA from Nagpur North spoke to TOI on a range of issues pertaining to the power ministry and Vidarbha in particular.

Excerpts...

Q. What are your immediate and future priorities?

A. There are many issues that need to be tackled in the power ministry. However, my immediate priority will be to make Maharashtra load-shedding free. Another area of concern is transmission and distribution losses, which need to be reduced to increase generation. There is unequal distribution of power in the state which needs to be looked at. Employment generation would be another area I would like to focus on.

Q. You seemed to have prior information about the change in your portfolio.

A. Being a senior member of the party, I was part of the decision-making process. The decision to change my portfolio was taken in my presence and with my consent. I’ve started holdings meetings with senior officials of all the three companies — Mahagenco, Mahatransco and MSEDCL. You will see good results soon.

Q. You spoke about employment generation.

A. Of course it’s a priority for Vidarbha. I am making efforts to expand Koradi thermal power plant in the next two years which will mean more jobs. I will work on reducing power tariffs for industries in Vidarbha and bring it on par with neighbouring Chhattisgarh. I am trying to explore the possibility of granting concessions to industries. I understand the concerns about pollution and will discuss with environmentalists all the issues they are concerned about. Preserving environment will be a priority. We would also promote solar power.

Q. Did the change in ministry upset you?

A. I consider myself as privileged as Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. He was the country’s first energy minister in former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s cabinet. Even before independence, he was allocated this portfolio. I am a staunch worker of the Ambedkarite movement. I’m capable of handling any responsibility entrusted to me by the party. I’m very happy to get a chance to look after this ministry.

Q. Doubts are being raised regarding the delay in portfolio allocation.

A. Please understand that we are a three-party coalition government with different ideologies and settling down will take some time. Nobody wanted fresh elections at such an early stage, neither the leaders nor the voters. We came together to keep the BJP away from power. We aim to ensure BJP-Mukt Bharat. No one should worry as our MVA government will complete its full five-year term.

Q. There were talks of many leaders getting upset over lower rung portfolios.

A. During discussions, differences emerge. This is part and parcel of politics. Issues are resolved through dialogues and discussions. The most important part is to ensure the good of the common man by working in any capacity. Ultimately, one’s hard work matters.

Q. Your government says its first priority is the farmer.

A. Even on the day of our oath-taking ceremony, CM Uddhav Thackeray had invited farmers at the venue as guests. Ours is a pro-farmer government which granted relief to them in the form of a loan waiver. We would resolve most of their grievances.

Q. Nagpur district has been given importance with five ministers.

A. That’s right. Speaker Nana Patole, Vijay Wadettiwar, Anil Deshmukh, Sunil Kedar and myself. This shows that our government is serious about developing Vidarbha which is a backward region.

Q. Are you going to be Nagpur’s guardian minister for the second time?

A. You will know about it, as and when the decision is taken by the government.

Charminar: Just three days after a massive Million March against CAA and NRC was held in the city, another protest has been planned on January 16 at Moghalpura. The rally has been planned by All India Majlis Inquilab-e-Millat. “The party has proposed a massive protest rally on January 16 from Moghalpura Kamaan to party office at Moghalpura, followed by a special prayer and the national anthem,” said Syed Taraq Quadri, president of the party.

The anti-people policy of the BJP government, he said, is nibbling away the democratic framework of the country and pushing it towards economic doom. “Unmindful of the repercussions of fomenting hatred and hegemony in the country, the government is trying to test the people using parliamentary powers as a tool to persecute them in their own country,” said Quadri.

The rally will begin at 4pm from Moghalpura Kamaan on January 16. A delegation of party leaders approached police seeking permission.

PORVORIM: Goa governor Satya Pal Malik expressed satisfaction on Tuesday that the overall law and order situation in Goa has remained under control with a 10.4% decline in crime rate in 2019.

Malik said that the government had managed to quell crime by using technology and by better utilisation of police personnel.

“Safety and security of tourists, women and children are the topmost priority of my government. The overall law and order situation in the state has remained under control,” Malik told the House.

According to the data brought out by Malik, the crime rate has declined by 10.4% in 2019 as compared to the previous year. “At the same time crime detection rate has increased to 84% in 2019 as against 82% in 2018 due to better staffing and implementation of various preventive measures and adoption of modern technology,” he said.

Goa police crackdown on the drug trade led to the registration of 213 cases and seizure of 84kg drugs worth Rs 5.7crore, Malik said. Recently, drugs worth Rs 3 crore were seized in a single raid by Goa police, he said.

The governor also lauded the traffic sentinel scheme for being the “best example of citizen’s participation” in traffic management. He also said that Goa police has launched the e-challan system to bring in transparency and enable digital payment for traffic offences.

Sadaf Jafar showers affection on her daughter on reaching her Gomtinagar residence

Lucknow: Her family members fixed their gaze at the mammoth gates of Lucknow district jail, waiting restlessly for hours before Sadaf Jafar finally walked out after 19 days, just a day before her 44th birthday. She was arrested on December 19 from the protest site at Parivartan Chowk in Lucknow.

Emotions ran high minutes after Jafar stepped out of jail. Her sister, Naheed, sprinted towards her and hugged her tightly. Jafar calmed her down and whispered in her ear — ‘sangharsh jari rahega’ (fight will continue). Holding hands of her sister, Naheed, and former IPS officer S R Darapuri, Jafar said, she will continue the struggle against the amended citizenship law. Worried about her kids, she then made a dash for home. Blurring the truma of her 19-day imprisonment, Jafar jumped like a kid the moment she entered the premises of her Gomtinagar residence.

She knocked at the gate which was opened by her 16-year old daughter, who got emotional at the sight of her mother and froze for a moment. Mother and daughter hugged each other even as Jafar kep consoling her by saying, ‘meri bahadur bacchi’ (my brave girl).

The domestic help spoke about how the trauma unfolded when Jafar was thrown behind bars and how her daughter cried for hours. “Are bewkoof roi kyu (why you cried),” said a concerned mother. She entered the house, holding her daughter's hand and expressing her love to every member of her family, including her pet whom she missed so much.

107,['8/01/2020'],Mobile vendors demand level playing field with e-tailers,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nagpur: As neighbourhood shop owners plan to take on e-commerce giants, mobile dealers from all over the country are expected to reach Delhi on Wednesday to attend a three-day meet organized by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). Around 50 mobile vendors from Nagpur, and over 200 from smaller centres in Vidarbha, may be attending the meet in which over 25,000 dealers from all over India are expected.

CAIT, an umbrella organization of traders’ associations across the country, is headed by B C Bhartia, a chartered accountant form Nagpur. The meet will include traders in other commodities too.

As the mobile vendors are planning a major show of strength, some brands have already agreed to change the terms of business to suit them. All the local associations of cell phone traders come under the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA). AIMS has received a letter from makers of Vivo phones that as a part of its 2020 strategy, the company will be offering consistent prices to both online and offline channels and also launch the same product across both channels.

The Vivo letter says, “we are in the process to streamline the equilibrium between online and offline channels. For all the existing Z and U series devices, we shall continue to sell through both channels till their end of life, which is very soon. There will be no addition in both the series during 2020,”

The traders’ main contention is against deep discounts offered at the e-commerce portals. This denies vendors a level playing field, they say. Mobile traders especially are also protesting against launching of exclusive online models of phones by the manufacturers.

“Traders from even small centres like Sakoli in Bhandara district will be reaching Delhi. The e-commerce giants have hit the conventional business hard. Offering discounts by the e-commerce companies amounts to violation of FDI policy,” said Arvinder Singh Bedi, vice-president of Nagpur Mobile Dealers Association (NMDA). Bhavesh Solanki, general secretary of AIMS, said the further strategy for the agitation will be decided after the meeting in Delhi.

CAIT had pleaded the deep discounts by e-commerce portals were violation of FDI policy in retail. Under the FDI norms, e-commerce could only provide a platform for trading and offering discounts amounts to direct selling which is against the norms. CAIT has already filed a case against e-commerce companies in Rajasthan high court.

Against 2.13 lakh vehicle registrations in 2017, the city registered only 1.71 lakh vehicles in 2019.According to a senior RTO official, one of the reasons for the decline in car sales is economic slowdown. “People have been finding it tough to manage their home budgets. I think, parking issues and traffic drives too have contributed to the decline,” he said. The RTO official said that the steep hike in traffic fines also affected the sales figures. “People have been going for car pool or taking radio cabs to escape hefty fines,” he added.The official said in 2019, barring October and August 2019, there was a decline in vehicle sales in the remaining 10 months in Ahmedabad city and other parts of the state.

Amaravati: Tension prevailed in Krishna and Guntur districts when groups of farmers and opposition party cadre blocked the national highway on Tuesday in protest against the proposed shifting of the state capital to Visakhapatnam.

Although police had imposed prohibitory orders, there were dharnas and blockades at many places in the two districts. The farmers demanded that the government should not shift the capital from Amaravati and recognize the sacrifices of farmers in giving land for the construction of the capital city.

Traffic on the national highway was disrupted near Mangalagiri, Gollapudi and Penamalur. Hundreds of heavy vehicles and APSRTC buses were stuck for nearly four hours during the protests.

Police kept a majority of the TDP cadre and leaders, including MPs Galla Jayadev and Kesineni Nani under house arrest as a preventive measure.

Tension prevailed at Galla Jayadev’s residence as well when the police locked the main gates to prevent him from going out. Police officials visited his residence and requested him to cooperate with them as there was no permission to stage dharnas and rasta rokos on the national highways.

The TDP activists shouted slogans against the police and demanded that they allow the MP to go out. Jayadev had an argument with cops demanding the reason for his detention.

The police detained former ministers Devineni Umamaheswara Rao, Prattipati Pullarao, former MLAs T Sravan Kumar, Alapati Rajendraprasad, Bonda Umamaheswara Rao, former MLC Babu Rajendraprasad and TDP senior leaders Panchumarthi Anuradha.

The police arrested former legislator and Guntur district TDP president GVSSR Anjaneyulu near Mangalagiri and took him to the police station. The police also arrested former ministers Nara Lokesh and Kollu Ravindra near Benz Circle when he visited the city to end the fast of local legislator Gadde Rammohan and shifted him to Thotlavallur police station.

The farmers’ protest near China Kakani of Mangalagiri mandal turned violent when the agitators attacked the vehicle of government whip Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy. The protestors also attacked Reddy’s security personnel causing commotion in the area.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranth Reddy’s vehicle was caught in traffic jam while he was proceeding to Vijayawada from his bungalow near Mangalagiri. However, the police took quick measures to provide passage to the minister’s vehicle.

Meanwhile, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu slammed the police for trying to curb peaceful agitations by farmers. He condemned the arrest of party functionaries including MPs and MLAs. He commended Palkol legislator Nimmala Ramanaidu for leading the agitation against the shifting of the capital city in West Godavari district.

Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi expressed deep concern over the government’s practice of filling up the posts of directors and deans 'on adhoc basis' in professional and technical colleges run by government societies in the Union territory.

She requested the secretaries of the societies concerned to review the present position and take necessary action to fill up the posts through proper selection trials adhering to the recruitment rules.

Bedi insisted that the government must abolish the practice of filling up vital posts on adhoc basis in departments and higher and technical educational institutions run by societies. She said the growth of higher educational institutions has been hampered due to the current practice.

She welcomed the appointment of the director of Indira Gandhi medical college and research institute managed by Perunthalaivar Kamarajar medical college society in a fair and transparent manner by a selection committee through open an advertisement.

She said the government accepted the recommendation of the committee and issued the offer of appointment to the director.

""There are a number of similarly-placed professional/technical colleges run by government societies. It is noted with concern that in many such institutions the posts of director/dean have been filled and continued on an adhoc basis without following the provisions of relevant rules of recruitment. The administrative secretaries are requested to review the position and take steps to fill up the post of head of professional/technical institutions in a time-bound manner,"" she said.

NAGPUR: Two groups — one led by Babasaheb Ambedkar Students Association (BASA) and the other by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) — claiming to be students of Nagpur University (NU) staged individual protests one after the other to condemn the attack by masked goons on students of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), at the Amravati Road campus on Tuesday morning.

Their request to hold simultaneous protests on either side of the entry point was turned down by cops. Both groups had organized the protests without police or university administration permission. Cops, who kept things under control for over three hours, warned they would be rounded up in case they stepped out of the campus.

The protesters stood inside the campus but right at the main entrance, blocking vehicular traffic from one side.

Ambazari cops handled the situation delicately by keeping both groups, having around 100 protesters each, away from each other till the end.

ABVP members, after speeches inside, tried to raise slogans outside on Amravati Road but were made to leave within minutes. Cops also didn’t allow any discussion among groups on the campus when the protests were underway. When BASA protest ended, cops asked them to report to their classroom or sit in the library till the ABVP agitation was going on.

The BASA members started their protests around 10am and were repeatedly asked by the cops to conclude the demonstration soon. The protesters requested more time as they wanted the teachers coming in by 11am to see their show of solidarity with the teaching community in view of the attack on JNU professors.

The ABVP protesters, who were asked to wait away from the main gate where BASA protest was underway, grew restless as time passed. Their request to let them hold a simultaneous protest on the other side of the entry point was turned down by the cops.

Sr PI Vijay Kare made it clear to ABVP members that unless BASA concludes their protest, they wouldn’t be allowed to start.

At 11am, as the BASA group relented and concluded their protest with the national anthem, ABVP members rushed to the entrance with loud slogans of Vande Mantram, Bharat Mata ki Jai, Tyar hojao sathiyo…bansi feko aur utha lo haatho mein hatiyar.

They slammed the Leftists, accusing them of “unleashing attacks on JNU students” even as news came in of Hindu Raksha Dal’s Pinky Chaudhary claiming responsibility for the Delhi episode.

ABVP’s Nagpur University campus pramukh Shrikant Malviya, who is a law student, distanced his organization from Hindu Raksha Dal’s Pinky Chaudhary. Malviya said people who want cheap publicity were making such comments.

The BASA members didn’t accuse any particular organization but accused hooligans of attacking innocent JNU students and demanded justice for them.

The NU administration remained a mute spectator to the developments on its premises.

NEW DELHI: With leaders across political spectrum, JNU alumni and Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone coming out in solidarity, the meeting called by JNU teachers and students on Tuesday saw emotions overflowing and a renewed call for removal of the vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar.

Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, CPI leader D Raja, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee, activists Yogendra Yadav and Kavita Krishnan and doctor Shah Alam Khan addressed the students after dodging the guards and entering from different gates. They all criticised the administration, the government and Delhi Police for inaction over the violence which unravelled in the campus on January 5.

Yechury said that MPs from different political parties will soon write a letter to the President of India, who is also the visitor of the university, requesting dismissal of the VC .

Towards the end of the programme, Padukone made an appearance taking the crowd by surprise. She did not address the students and teachers gathered and said that she was present to express her solidarity with the students. Kanhaiya Kumar, along with other students, raised slogans of “Aazadi” and “Sarfaroshi ki tamana ab hamare dil mein hai.”

JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, however, later said that Padukone should have spoken as Bollywood celebrities are looked up as role models.

Sohail Hashmi, Shamsul Islam, Omkar Goswami and others took part in march called by the varsity alumni.

When Kavita Krishnan was addressing the students, a drone made an appearance in the sky. Students waved back at it and the speakers later questioned where was the drone when students and teachers were being attacked.

Kanhaiya Kumar said the BJP government had no issue to fight in Delhi elections so they picked up JNU. “The JNU administration says that students switched off the server, but it is the government which is known for switching off the internet. MHRD and JNU administration have different narratives on the same matter,” said Kumar.

“January 5 attack is not a normal assault, we have to understand why JNU was chosen for such an attack,” said Yechury.

Yogendra Yadav said: “This is not left versus right, but right versus the wrong. The vice-chancellor is the enemy of the institution he heads, so he has to go.”

Jamia teachers had also gathered on the campus to express their solidarity with the students and teachers of JNU.

Allahabad high court

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Tuesday set at rest the controversy regarding the declaration of result of the Assistant Teachers Recruitment Examination-2018, and dismissed about 60 writ petitions, keeping into account the lower qualifying marks as fixed by the government order (GO) issued on May 21, 2018, which was later withdrawn.

The order came from a bench of Justice Abdul Moin, who held that after detailed discussions in the judgment, he did not find any merit in any of the petitions, which challenged the GO dated February 20, 2019 and demanded that the results should be declared as the qualifying marks set by the GO dated May 21, 2018.

Opposing the petitions, additional advocate general Kuldeep Pati Tripathi had argued that the decision of the state government was lawful, owing to the indulgence of the court as regard the previous GOs. Tripathi further added that the decision was taken to pick and select best candidates for the job. While recruiting the candidates, the state government had issued GO dated January 9, 2018 whereby fixing 45% qualifying marks for general and OBC candidates and 40% for SC/ST category. Later, the state government issued another GO on May 21, 2018 whereby decreasing the minimum qualifying marks as 33 for general and OBC and 30 for SC/ST. Subsequently, after an interference by the HC on a writ petition, the state government on February 20, 2019 cancelled the GO dated May 21, 2018 and started process for examination by keeping in account the previous GO dated January 9, 2018.

It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that if minimum qualifying mark was lowered as was set by GO dated May 21, 2018, more candidates could be adjusted against the posts as number of posts are already vacant. HC held that no case was made out for interference in the matter.

Taking exception to the police inaction, Nizamia students said the nexus between the attackers at JNU and security personnel has been exposed, and the central government has failed to protect women in the country.

“It does seem security failure in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, which encouraged the thugs,” said Ayesha, one of the agitating students. “The goons continued to disturb peace and tranquillity in presence of police at leading educational institutions. The security personnel appeared to have surrendered to these goons who were on a rampage.”

The students felt that the move to bring CAA , NRC and NPR has not only united people, but also made take to the streets. “We have gathered to stand by students who were beaten up brutally in India’s leading university. We want to give a clear message to hate-mongers that their policy will not go on, and their attack unite us all further,” said Mohammed Maas Hussain, a student.

123,['8/01/2020'],Farm distress hits tractor sales,"Ahmedabad: Registration of tractors in Gujarat has fallen for the second year straight, indicating distress in agriculture. Tractor registrations in the state stood at 41,000 in 2019, down 14.58% from 48,000 in 2018. In 2017, tractor registrations in the state stood at 53,000, which had declined by 9.43% in 2018. Figures show that in the last two years, tractor registrations have declined by 22.65%.According to farmers, the decline in tractor sales is due to the bad monsoon and overall economic distress combined with a severe liquidity crunch.“Agriculture is rapidly becoming unprofitable. Due to the liquidity crunch, many farmers are choosing to rent tractors rather than buying them,” said Vithal Dudhatra, a farmer leader from Amreli.Dudhatra added that two consecutive bad monsoons have added to the woes of farmers and their income has declined while their expenditure has increased. Ramesh Patel, another farmer from Amreli, said he was planning to buy a tractor but scrapped the idea. “There is a government subsidy scheme but after the calculations, I decided to rent rather than buy. If I buy a tractor I will have to pay instalments. Renting a tractor for Rs 500 per day reduces my burden,” Patel said. A senior state agriculture department official said that due to the decline in farm yields, farmers have been incurring losses for the last two years. He said that there are very few takers for the government subsidy on tractor purchases.

Hyderabad: American IT major Micron Technology picked up 1.03 million square feet (10.3 lakh sft) of space at Phoenix’s Tech Zone in Nanakramguda, making it the single largest leasing deal among Telangana’s SEZs.

The lease application was approved on Tuesday, confirmed A Ram Mohan Reddy, zonal development commissioner of Visakhapatnam SEZ (VSEZ) which comprises AP, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. He said the firm would soon occupy 14 floors in the newly constructed SEZ.

“Beginning February 28, 2020, Micron will operate from a temporary incubation space measuring 91,625 sft in the SEZ. Once the permanent office is ready, the operations will move there,” Reddy said. “Micron’s projected investment for the next five years is Rs 3,820 crore, with exports of up to Rs 6,228 crore. The company has also assured employment to 5,000 people – 3,500 men and 1,500 women – over the next five years.”

Industry sources said the leasing agreement between Micron and Phoenix was brokered by global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.

Jayesh Ranjan, the state’s IT secretary, said: “They (Micron) had conveyed their intention to expand in Hyderabad significantly on the day of their inaugural. I am happy that the ramp up has happened much faster than expected.”

Micron Technology, which made its first stop in India at Bengaluru, entered Hyderabad in 2019 and set up its Global Development Centre in Madhapur. The centre was officially inaugurated in October last year.

“In the last nine months we have sanctioned lease for 73 units across the 53 SEZs in the zone. Of this, 70% are in Telangana and rest in Andhra Pradesh. Some of the big leases, apart from Micron, have been between 1 lakh and 3 lakh sft,” Reddy said.

Headquartered in Boise (Idaho), Micron provides computer memory and computer data storage solutions. It has a presence across 18 countries and 37,000 team members.

Chennai: TOI spoke to transport minister M R Vijayabaskar on the proliferation of share autos and what plans the government has, if at all, to regulate them.

The number of share autos in the city has gone up steadily but there has been no effort to regularise their operation. Why?

It is not that they are completely let off the hook. We are trying our best to take action against those who violate rules. But most of the operators approach courts and orders are issued keeping connectivity to interior areas in mind. But share auto drivers end up driving on the main roads.

By operating on main roads that are also bus routes, aren’t share autos eating into MTC’s revenue?

Yes. It has affected revenue. As of now, there is no rule specifying routes for share autos. They are everywhere, operated as per the driver’s wish. But efforts will be taken to frame rules and regularise their operations in the future.

So after regularisation, will they be run as stage carriers or as contract carriages?

It is difficult to comment on this now as staff strength during enforcement drive will be a problem. We need more hands to look into all these details. But we will check tax, permit, route and other major violations.

Besides permits, crimes involving share autos suggest that they are becoming unsafe and there is hardly any accountability. What steps will be taken to prevent such crimes?

It is not that we can’t track share autos. Details of vehicle owners can be tracked using the registration number. But it is true that owners are renting out vehicles to drivers without checking their antecedents. We have told collectors to keep a tab on this.

130,['8/01/2020'],Madurai: Stir over Avaniapuram jallikattu panel spills over to second day,"This story is from January 8, 2020

MADURAI: Protests continued for the second consecutive day at Avaniapuram against the district collector’s order that the organising committee of the jallikattu this year would include the name Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam.

The protesting villagers say V K Kannan, an outsider who claimed to be the president of the sangam, was trying to usurp the rights of the traditional organisers of the game by staking claim to the organising committee. The villagers want the committee to be named Avaniapuram jallikattu organising committee. However, the collector has said that Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam should also figure in the name.

On Tuesday, about 75 villagers staged a protest near the bus stand alleging partiality by the district administration towards Kannan, who they said was not giving due consideration to the welfare of all villagers.

Their main demand is that the name of farmers association be removed from the organising committee. They also said that Kannan was holding talks with members of other communities who were not the real community leaders. “This was not a real representation of the communities,” said K R Murugan, one of the protesters.

On the other hand, members of Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam put out posters in Avaniapuram thanking the district collector for allowing them to conduct the games this year.

Meanwhile, members of five communities from Alanganallur submitted a petition to the collector seeking representation for all communities on the committee of the famous Alanganallur jallikattu this year.

AMROHA: Two newborns, aged four days and six days, died at a private hospital in Amroha district , leading to protests by their family members who alleged that “wrong” injections administered by doctors led to the deaths. Officials of the district health department rushed to the hospital and ordered a probe into the deaths in Gajraula town on Monday.

The children died three days after their admission at the hospital, and their parents claimed that their bodies had “turned black”.

The first infant, born six days ago, fell sick and was admitted to the private hospital three days ago. Pintu, the father of the child and a resident of Sihali Gosai village of Gajraula, said he had admitted the child after a pediatrician asked him to do so.

While the other infant was born at a government hospital four days ago. He and his mother Yasmeen were discharged from the hospital after normal delivery. “But, the child was not taking milk and was crying constantly,” his father, Usmaan, a resident of Azad Nagar, said. He also took the child to the private hospital in Gajraula.

Both the infants died on Monday evening.

“Pediatrician of the hospital told me that the child will be fine soon. He gave him some medicines and injections. The child turned black and died,” alleged Usman.

The family members of the other accused made the same allegations.

On Tuesday, Amroha’s chief medical officer (CMO) Ramesh Chandra Sharma visited the hospital and questioned the alleged doctor.

Chandra said, “I went to the private hospital. I inquired about the matter thoroughly and found that Pintu’s wife had premature delivery in a separate hospital. The child weighed only 1.5kg, and was badly infected. Besides, the other infant was born in a government hospital. He was later admitted to the private hospital by his family members as he was crying and not taking milk. Doctors had asked the family members to show him to another doctor. The family members were taking him to another private hospital when he died on the way. He was suffering from abdomen infection. However, a probe is on.”

Aligarh Muslim University (File Photo)

AGRA: Student leaders of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Tuesday asked all those who witnessed the December 15 violence against the students or were injured or illegally detained to come forward and submit their personal accounts before the National Human Right Commission (NHRC). The Allahabad high court on Tuesday asked the NHRC to probe the role of police into the violence.

Meanwhile, a group consisting students and teachers of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Tuesday moved Allahabad high court with a writ petition, seeking probe into the role of district administration, paramilitary force and varsity administration in the December 15 violence. The legal team of AMU Coordination Committee filed the writ on Tuesday.

In its directive, the court said, “The commission is requested to complete the process of inquiry/investigation within a period of one month from the date of presentation of the complaint by the officer authorized. Also convey its findings and recommendations, if any, to this court immediately after conclusion of the inquiry”.

Former president of AMU’s students union, Salman Imtiaz, said, “We have asked all students to submit videos, photographs or any other related evidence to AMUSU or NHRC for further action. We demand AMU administration to provide us with the CCTV footages of the university campus of the December 15. We will provide the necessary assistance to the witnesses.”

Welcoming the high court decision, another student leader Faizul Hassan said that students are hopeful of a fair inquiry into the matter. “We hope that the commission will look into the complaints of students as they have been subjected to police brutalities and several FIRs have been lodged upon them to suppress their voices,” said the student leader.

133,['8/01/2020'],Don’t suppress dissent: Evicted lawyer,"This story is from January 8, 2020

NEW DELHI: A day after 27-year-old lawyer from Kerala , Surya Rajappan , and her roommate were evicted from their rented flat in Lajpat Nagar for protesting against CAA and NRC during Union home minister Amit Shah ’s door-to-door campaign, the former argued in favour of letting “voices of dissent to be heard loud and clear”.

The two women had displayed anti-CAA-NRC banners from the balcony of their flat when Shah was in the area on an election campaign on Sunday. Asserting that they were only exercising their “constitutional and democratic right to peacefully protest”, Rajappan said in a statement on Wednesday: “As a common citizen, this was the perfect opportunity for me to register my dissent in front of the home minister himself. I sincerely believe that had I failed to do so, I would have failed my own conscience.”

Speaking to TOI, Rajappan said, “Our intention was not to malign a party...but being evicted for holding a political view is wrong and should not become the norm.” She added that “fence-sitters” need to speak out because this was the time to fight for the “idea of India” and not any political ideology.

She said the intent of their peaceful protest was to assert that not every onlooker to Shah’s pro-CAA parade was in support of it. “My flatmate and I displayed a home-made handcrafted banner bearing the words ‘Shame’, ‘CAA’ (crossed out), ‘NRC’ (crossed out), ‘Jai Hind’, ‘Azaadi’ and ‘#NotInMyName’. A conscious decision was made on our part to ensure that there were no derogatory, rhetoric words or phrases directed against or towards Shah, or any other members of the ruling dispensation,” the statement added.

The lawyer said that those participating in the rally were enraged and “visibly agitated” when they noticed their protests and “verbally harassed and intimidated” them. Some of them first made derogatory and misogynistic remarks and, then, forced their way up the stairs that led to their residence. Rajappa said she did not anticipate such a strong and violent reaction to a peaceful protest, and, fearing for their lives, they locked themselves inside their house while the “mob” violently banged at their door, until the police intervened.

She also said that her landlord, who was part of the angry crowd, bolted and locked the common entrance, which led to the stairway of their apartment, forcing the duo to call friends for help. The women, she said, were locked inside for nearly four hours until her father was allowed to enter the premises along with a police officer.

When TOI reached out to the landlord, he first refused to identify himself and later claimed he had handed over a notice to the tenants since, their “act” had caused “problems for the others”. Requesting anonymity, he also claimed that he would have told them to leave immediately, but gave them a notice since they were women. “I don't want to speak about it further,” he said. Rajappan’s neighbours said the women had acted “irresponsibly”, as a result of which they drew people’s ire.

President of International Diabetes Federation Dr Andrew JM Bulton said that diabetes is reversible. Once the medication starts, it can’t be stopped.

While delivering his lecture, Dr Amit Ghosh of the Mayo Clinic in UK said, “Doctors should try to explain the medical condition and suitable treatment to the patients. It is the responsibility of doctors to address all the queries of the patients.”

President of the Indian Academy of Diabetes, Dr Shashank Joshi said that there is a need to work on prevention more than treating diabetes.

He said, “The prevention of diabetes is possible. Having meals on time, getting full sleep and walking for 45 minutes daily will help in balancing weight according to height. Obesity is the major cause of diabetes.”

135,['8/01/2020'],Ruling party MLAs fear backlash over capital relocation,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Amaravati: YSRC legislators in most of the districts from Krishna to Chittoor are remaining silent about chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s decision to shift the capital city as they are worried about the party’s prospects in upcoming local body elections.

Although the ministers were supporting the plan, many legislators are not on the same page. But none of them is ready to go against the party president’s decision.

Sources said MLAs from Krishna and Guntur districts were upset about the new capital proposal.

“As a legislator from Krishna district, I, too, wanted the capital to remain in Amaravati. But I will abide by the party line,” said Vasantha Krishnaprasad, YSRC MLA from Mylavaram in Krishna district.

Rejecting the TDP call to quit the assembly, Krishnaprasad said opposition leaders were raking up needless controversy.

In order to placate capital city farmers, YSRC legislators are promising that the chief minister would do justice to them. “Farmers should not fall prey to Chandrababu Naidu’s designs. The CM is committed to do justice to farmers. Our government will not act against their wishes,” said Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy. The chief minister held a special meeting with the legislators from Krishna and Guntur districts last fortnight soon after taking a call to shift the administration to Visakhapatnam and appraised them of the situation.

The legislators who attended the meeting reluctantly agreed to the proposal as they were aware of the consequences in their constituencies. “Whether we are happy or unhappy is not an issue here. We are with our leader and we will back any decision taken by him,” said Ambati Rambabu.

The legislators from Krishna and Guntur districts knew well that real estate sector would boom even in remote constituencies only when the capital is in Amaravati. The rise in land value and real estate sector could be the biggest resource to them and party functionaries down the level to consolidate their financial position to fight polls.

They fear it would be difficult for them to find resourceful candidates in upcoming elections given uncertainty over the capital. “We can manage the situation as long as people do not believe that the decision to shift the capital was taken to target a particular community. This kind of feeling might make others too distance from the party,” said a legislator from Palnadu region.

Sources said the YSRC leadership had closely tracked the situation in Rayalaseema and was relieved after finding that the situation was under control. Initially, the party leadership suspected that protests might spread to Rayalaseema as they would be the biggest sufferers due to shifting of the capital.

According to sources, the party leadership is relaxed after getting intelligence reports that suggested that Rayalaseema region was not concerned about the move.

Ahmedabad: The charity commissioner on Tuesday restrained the Jagannath Mandir Jamalpur Trust from alienating any of its properties, after the commissioner received complaints that the trust was handing out its land to the minority community.

The charity commissioner condemned the deliberate action on part of the temple trust to alienate trust property to “the stranger”.

The commissioner ordered that the possession of such alienated properties must be handed over to the trust “for the purpose of maintaining the rule of law and public tranquillity and sentiments”.

The commissioner said so after observing that the Jagannath temple is associated with the Rath Yatra for over a century and people’s sentiments are attached to the temple and its activities.

The charity commissioner also said that if the trust wants to alienate any property, it must follow the procedure under the Bombay Public Trusts Act.

The charity commissioner held that the efforts to alienate properties in 11 different survey numbers are in violation of statutory provisions and are nothing but the “sale of the properties” and are “non-executable”. The charity commissioner also ordered the district collectorate and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation not to allow a change in the revenue records without following due procedure. “If any entry is mentioned, it must be cancelled,” the order reads.

The charity commissioner, however, did not find evidence proving all complaints, but found that the trust and the sole trustee, Mahant Dilipdasji, had leased out four land parcels and properties in Behrampura and Danilimda areas to private persons.

Lease land to developer, Yasin Ghanchi, who was granted a plot in Survey No. 138 for three years had recently generated lot of controversy.

But the charity commissioner said that the type of lease document signed by the trustees was nothing less than alienation of the property by the trust.”

Hyderabad: The students’ community from city universities has geared up to participate in the all India general strike on Wednesday in solidarity with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi.

Students from University of Hyderabad (UoH), Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu), English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) and Osmania University (OU) have decided to participate in the strike by voluntarily boycotting classes.

“Since many students have exams, we have given a call for voluntary boycott of classes. All students will be assembling near the Life Sciences building from where we will march towards the administrative building,” said Abhishek Nandan, president of UoH students union. Condemning the JNU attacks in Delhi, the Students Federation of India wing at UoH held a protest at north and south shopping complexes within the campus on Tuesday evening.

The EFLU students’ union also issued a statement condemning the violence unleashed at JNU. “The ruling government at the Centre has notoriously tried to crush the students’ movement in universities across the country by using the state machinery as well as its stormtroopers (ABVP),” read the statement.

Students termed the attack on JNU students as a war declared by the Modi government on “university students who have been the principal voice of opposition against the anti-people, anti-poor, anti-farmer and anti-minority violence unleashed by the same Delhi police against the students of Jamia Milia Islamia University.”

Amid the strike call, there are many students who are worried about their exams that are scheduled on January 8. “Osmania University has their LLB exam tomorrow. This in view of the Bharath bandh, which many trade unions are supporting. Also, auto strike is there tomorrow in Telangana,” tweeted Naresh Jain.

Schools and degree colleges have decided to go ahead with the schedule despite the strike call. “We have practical exams for Class 10 and Class 12 students,” said Varalakshmi, principal of Jubilee Hills Public School. “There is no way that we can afford to lose more academic days in view of bandhs. We will be going as per schedule given out by the Central Board of Secondary Education.”

He said Chandrababu Naidu was using farmers’ protests to disrupt law and order in the state. Pinnelli along with legislators Ambati Rambabu and Vidadala Rajani met chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy in the evening and explained to him about the attack.

Later, speaking to reporters, Ramakrishna Reddy said Naidu and his son Lokesh would not be able to step on to streets if they resorted to violent politics.

“Naidu, keep in mind that I am from Palnadu, known for its courage! I am not going to be scared by your silly tactics. Remove your mask and try to touch YSRC leaders and see the consequences,” Reddy warned. “Unless it is planned, why would the protestors be ready with stones and sticks?” Reddy asked.

He suggested to farmers to meet the chief minister and tell him their requests. He said TDP was trying to divert the protest and create law and order trouble. tnn

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data shows 626 patients tested positive for dengue

NAGPUR: Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data shows 626 patients tested positive for dengue, the most dreadful vector-borne disease, in 2019.Until now, the highest-ever dengue positive cases were 601 in 2014. Second highest 566 were registered in 2018. There were 352 cases in 2013, 230 in 2015, 199 in 2017 and 195 in 2016.The number of suspected patients was low in 2019, at 2,356 cases. Private hospitals test patients in their in-house laboratories or get the test done from private laboratories using rapid diagnostic kit (RDK) technology. Patients found positive under RDK are termed as suspect cases by NMC. Private hospitals start treatment of dengue for all suspect patients.Then, NMC tests blood samples of these patients using the state government’s enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology.Highest-ever suspected cases of 5,684 were recorded in 2018. Earlier, highest cases were 3,722 in 2014 followed by 1,405 in 2017, 1,254 in 2015 and 1,236 in 2016. The cases were below 1,000 in rest of the years.Highest suspect as well as positive cases were registered in September, October and November, which are basically post-monsoon days. Cases started to surge from August. Cases came down in December with commencement of winter season.Fortunately, only one patient died of dengue in entire year, in September.The high number of dengue cases hints at unhygienic conditions in various parts of the city, especially in residential areas. NMC has been initiating various measures since 2016 to curb cases. For last three years, civic body is conducting activities through out the year like inspection of households, destroying mosquito-breeding spots, awareness etc. Still, cases are not coming down.NMC official told TOI surge in cases was due to various reasons. “Humidity was high in monsoon compared with previous years. Monsoon was late and heavy rainfall was witnessed in September and October too. Besides, earlier NMC used to test using IgG Elisa kit, which changed to NS1 Elisa kit, which gives a perfect report,” the official said.The official added private hospitals and laboratories started to give timely and accurate reports to NMC, which is also an another reason for increase in patients. “Earlier, reports used to come from very few hospitals and laboratories. It is a welcome move that reports are coming to NMC. We send teams immediately to areas where suspect patient stay and undertake mitigation measures. It prevents spread of dengue,” the official said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73145923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-364514,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-registers-highest-ever-dengue-positive-cases-in-19/articleshow/73145923.cms

TAMIL NADU: The Tamil Nadu Latin Bishops’ Council has condemned the attack on the students at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi.

In a statement, Archbishop of Madurai Rev Dr Antony Pappusamy has said that there is no reason to believe that the attack on the students of JNU was not a preplanned one. “It is an attack which is highly condemnable. JNU is one of the most reputed institutes of higher education in the country and it is a matter of shame that such an attack took place in its campus,” he said.

Such an attack on students who were only demanding the rights of the people was undemocratic and against the soul of India. Nobody who believes in democracy would accept the attacks on the students.

Universities are not just places of giving knowledge, it is a place which shows the students to be sensitive to the needs of the outside world. The Indian society knows well that this university has been providing this to the students. It is the reason why renowned scientists, philosophers and thinkers who are beyond religion have emerged from this campus. It is the responsibility of the rulers that this continues in this institution, he added.

One of the women who suffered food poisoning at Bhestan station

SURAT: A one-day picnic to enjoy ponk , a famed winter delicacy of Surat, turned into a bitter experience for a group of 35 women from Mumbai after they suffered food poisoning on-board Shatabdi Express on Tuesday.

The women from Borivili and Kandivili suburbs of Mumbai started falling ill one after another after eating packaged bread and butter provided by the pantry staff of the train. The women, mostly housewives, were on a day’s picnic to Surat from Mumbai to enjoy a ponk (a snack made from tender roasted sorghum grains) party.

After many of them started vomiting and complained of stomach ache, some of them stopped the train by pulling the chain at Bhestan station at around 8:25am. Four women whose condition had worsened were given immediate treatment at the station.

Jagruti Mehta, who had organized the trip, said, “We were given bread and butter in breakfast in C7 coach. Both these items were infested with fungus. The bread packet had expiry date of January 5, 2020. Some of us had asked the staff not to distribute unhygienic food to us, but they didn’t listen. Some of the women had immediate effect and began to vomit. We stopped the train at Bhestan at 8.25am by pulling the chain.”

Anju Chokshi, another affected woman, said, “More than 30 of us suffered because of the unhealthy food. We had spent so much of money to travel in Shatabdi Express, but recklessness of the pantry staff made us fall sick. The condition of four of us was terrible.”

The IRCTC has penalized the contractor of Rs two lakh and issued a notice of termination. On board supervisor of the train has been suspended too.

Surat railway station director TL Garuda said, “Two were given injections and two treated with oral medicines. We brought the train to Surat station and the affected patients were kept under observation for two hours.”

Rakesh Shah, member of Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC), who was in Ahmedabad, boarded the return Shatabdi Express and checked all food samples at Ahmedabad and Vadodara.

Ahmedabad: The complainant and the father of children who were allegedly detained at the Nithyananda ashram vehemently objected the bail applications filed in the Gujarat high court by two ashram administrators – Sriharini Chellapan alias Pranapriya and Ridhi Ravikiran alias Tatvapriya.

Both sadhvis of Nithyananda sought bail from the high court after a sessions court refused to free him over the complaint of illegal detention of minor children, abusing them and forced labour in the ashram, which was being run on the Delhi Public School (East) campus.

The complainant also said that his older daughter called him and “mentioned a conspiracy being hatched by Nithyananda himself with ‘Ranjitha’,’Ma Pranapriya’, ‘Ma Priyatattva’ and ‘Ma Bhaktipriya’ and that too with complete support of socialite ‘Ma Pooja Manjula Shroff’ and ‘Shree Amitabh Shah’ to smuggle my daughters out of the country without the knowledge of my wife and I”. The complainant also claimed that his two minor children have given statements under Section 164 of the CrPC before a judicial magistrate, that have not yet been placed in the investigation papers.

143,['8/01/2020'],Standing panel trims hike in building plan sanction charges,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nagpur: Standing committee of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Tuesday reduced the revised rates proposed for sanctioning building plan for new constructions or regularizing unauthorized constructions.

Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane told media persons that the town planning department had upped the development and building plan sanction charges to 60%. “The town planning department had proposed to revise building plan sanction charges from existing Rs15,000 to Rs24,200 per square meters. We have reduced the same to Rs17,000,” said Pohane. Similar cuts have also been suggested in fees of other heads too, he added.

The panel also reduced premium being charged to exclude staircase, passage, lobby, lift etc from carpet area from the existing 4% to 2.5% of the ready reckoner value of the property. The department had proposed to hike the charge to 5%.

The department’s proposal to revise tree deposit was, however, kept unchanged. The department had proposed to double the tree deposit from existing Rs500 to Rs1,000 and it remains intact, he said.

“Now, the proposals will be tabled before the general body and then only the revision will come into force,” said Pohane.

Along with this proposal, the standing panel also okayed 59 other proposals wherein it cleared administrative approvals to civic works worth Rs18.18 crore and work orders for development works worth Rs18.65 crore.

The functioning of the NMC’s estate department has come under scanner after it submitted a proposal to sanction 7,000 sqft plot on Orange City Street to Madhucon Project to operate its ready mix plant (RMP) for a monthly rent of Rs1.38 lakh. While bagging the contract to concretize 5.5km tar road along Orange City Street, the firm had claimed it owns a ready mix plant at Pardi. In reality, the firm does not have such a plant. Though the firm had started the RMP way back, the estate department submitted the proposal now and the standing panel had also okayed it. When pointed out, Pohane said the NMC will recover rent from the firm from the date it had started the RMP.

Amaravati: Former minister and senior YSRC MLA Dharmana Prasada Rao has requested the President of India to declare Amaravati capital city as illegal as it was selected against Professor Sivaramakrishnan committee recommendations.

In his letter to the President, Dharmana said the TDP government declared Amaravati as new capital without considering the expert committee’s recommendations. “The report was not discussed in the cabinet or in the assembly/ legislative council. Declaring Amaravati as capital is unconstitutional as it violated the fundamental principle of justice and equality of opportunity enshrined in the Constitution,” said Dharmana.

He said declaring Amaravati as capital was illegal as it violated the provisions of the AP Reorganization Act 2014 and did not follow the expert committee’s recommendations. Moreover, the decision was not notified in any official gazette or by any government order. He said it was unfortunate that constitutional functions were not conducted from the common capital Hyderabad and were run from a place which did not have legal sanctity.

The expert committee had suggested that the new state capital should not be in Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri region since it has fertile agriculture land and not suitable for high-rise buildings and expensive cost of construction.

He said the YSRC government was making a serious attempt to revisit decisions taken by the previous government by following the recommendation of the expert committees.

In this context, Dharmana requested the President to use his good offices to direct the government of India to recognize that the decision on Amaravati as unconstitutional, illegal as it was not notified either by gazette or by any government order and make necessary changes in the map of India published by the Survey of India.

Illustration used for representational purpose

AGRA: A 39-year-old woman and her paramour, a junior engineer with MCD South Zone, were arrested by Agra police on Tuesday for alleged murder of her husband two days ago. The two came to know each other through social media and were desperate to get married, cops say.

According to police, BSNL junior technical officer Virender Kumar, 45, was found murdered some 400 meters away from his home near Deep Inter College of Shahganj police jurisdiction in Agra on Sunday morning. Virendra was married to Bhawna for nearly eight years and had two children. The family was living in Panchsheel colony of the city .

Agra SSP Babloo Kumar said: “Within 48 hours of murder, three persons, including the victim’s wife, her paramour 31-year-old Kapil Kumar and his associate Manish Kumar Singh were arrested.”

“During the probe, our team came to know about the illicit affair between Bhawna and Kapil. They came to know each other through Facebook and later decided to get settled. A month back, the two accused along with Kapil’s associate Manish hatched a plan to eliminate Virender Kumar. On January 4 evening, Kapil borrowed his colleague Deepak’s car and drove Agra along with Manish. At around midnight, the two entered into Virender’s house with the help of Bhawna and murdered him,” the SSP said.

Speaking to TOI, Shahganj SHO Arvind Kumar Singh said: “The deceased Virender Kumar was heavily drunk. The three accused strangulated the victim with the help of mobile phone’s USB cable and also rained kicks and punches to ensure that he dies of internal bleeding. Later Kapil and Manish carried his body in the and dumped it near Deep Inter College. The two then went back to Delhi.”

“In order to misguide the police and family, accused Bhawna claimed that Virender left home with Rs 7000 cash after he received a call on late Saturday night and did not return home. Examinations of phone call records of the victim and his wife revealed that Bhawna was lying and later confessed to her crime,” the SHO added.

Kapil Kumar hails from Ashok Vihar Colony of Agra which is close to the victim’s house, while co-accused Manish is immediate neighbour of Virender. According to police, Manish was preparing for government job while Bhawna has done MSc in zoology.

Bengaluru: Observing that spiritual organisations are not above the law, the high court on Tuesday directed Isha Foundation , headed by Jaggi Vasudev , to file an additional statement disclosing the amount it has collected so far for the ‘ Cauvery Calling ’ project and state if it had the authorisation to collect money from the public.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas pulled up the foundation for not specifying if the amounts are being collected voluntarily. While looking at the statement submitted by the foundation in response to a PIL filed against the project by city-based advocate AV Amarnathan, the bench noted that it had claimed to be a spiritual organisation.

“Even spiritual organisations are bound by law. In the name of spirituality, what are you doing? Don’t be under the impression that if you are a spiritual organisation, you are not bound by law,” the bench noted. It pointed out that in its first statement of objections, the foundation hadn’t mentioned the contributions were voluntary.

Looking at the number of eminent persons, including a retired Supreme Court judge, who have been shown as part of the foundation, the bench asked whether consent of those persons had been obtained or not.

During the hearing, Isha Foundation’s counsel claimed the project is to create awareness among the public, especially farmers, about the environment.

However, the bench said though the cause is a good one, the same cannot be embarked upon by forcing people to pay money. The bench also wanted to know whether it had got any authorisation for collecting money.

State got no complaints

The court also took the state government to task as to why no enquiries were made about Isha Foundation collecting money for ‘Cauvery Calling’. The additional advocate general stated that no complaints have been received and no government land is being used to carry out the project.

The state government said it is not sponsoring or financing the Cauvery Calling project and the foundation is participating in the agro-forestation project of the state government, just like any other agency.

In his PIL, Amarnathan claimed that Isha Foundation was collecting Rs 42 from the public to plant each sapling and aims to collect Rs 10,626 crore from planting a targeted 253 crore saplings along the 639km Cauvery river basin. He claimed that the project was being undertaken without any study or permission and private organisations cannot be permitted to collect money with-out prior approval of the government.

New Delhi: A city court on Wednesday directed Tihar Jail authorities to immediately provide medical aid to Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad who, according to his lawyers, is suffering from a blood thickening condition — polycythemia .

The hearing, however, was adjourned to Thursday owing to non-production of Azad’s medical reports. The jail authorities have sought time to file Azad’s medical report in response to his application seeking treatment at AIIMS.

The plea filed by Azad’s lawyers claimed that his condition required continuous check-up from the doctors concerned. “His treatment is going on for a long time under the supervision of the doctor concerned and requires day-to-day check-up. He needs to be treated within a week or maximum 10 days when the blood turns thick, which may lead to a cardiac attack,” the plea added.

Azad was arrested after he surrendered before Delhi Police early on December 21. He was refused a bail and sent to Tihar Jail for 14 days in judicial custody by a court.

He and 15 other people have been charged under sections 147, 148, 149, 436, 427, 323, 186, 353, 332, 120B with Section 34 of IPC and sections 3 and 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.

151,['8/01/2020'],"Four of family elected to panel, vendors move HC","This story is from January 8, 2020

CHANDIGARH: Street vendors have challenged the town vending committee election and taken the panel to the Punjab and Haryana high court over alleged derogation of statutory provisions of their governing law.

The high court has issued a notice to the UT administrator, municipal corporation, MC commissioner, and committee chairman to seek their reply. The vendors want the court to dismiss the notification of March 30, 2016, by which the committee was formed, and then order for its proper constitution. The hearing is on February 25.

The petitioners’ lawyer, Deepender Patwali, argued that under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, the local authority has to first identify and register the vendors before conducting elections to select their representatives. In the present case, the town vending committee was made without first registering the vendors. Petitioners claim that it robbed them of the right to participate in the election and file nomination.

They claim that the constitution of the committee is illegal and arbitrary, since four vendors shown to have been elected as members pay tehbazari (rent for the stall) and belong to one family . The petition says there had been no real election as well, since these four were the only nominees. Petitioners are shocked that in the ongoing dispute of re-election and allocation, this group of four will now protect the interest of registered vendors.

It was submitted that the city had only 465 tehbazari vendors as opposed to 21,622 street vendors of the other kind, of which 9,356 are registered, and this itself proved that former did not represent the interest of the entire group. Also, of all those tehbazari vendors, only 64 are registered, and four out of those could not be true representatives of their business community. Petitioners claimed the town vending committee was constituted without their knowledge, which was another violation of the 2014 Act and 2015 Rules.

Petitioners claim they were under the impression that after registration, they would have the right to participate in elections to a proper committee constituted by the respondents in consonance with the provisions of the Act. Since relocation, vendors have been running from pillar to post to protect their rights. They say that after being shifted to Sector 15, they realized that the respondents had failed to constitute a proper panel. They are most angry about being robbed of their right to vote.

152,['8/01/2020'],HC clears the decks for Telangana municipal polls,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: After keeping the State Election Commission (SEC) on tenterhooks for a day, the Telangana high court gave the green signal to issue the notification for polls to 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations late on Tuesday.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy dismissed the PIL filed by PCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy accusing the SEC of confusing people with its actions in respect of poll notification and poll schedule. SEC had issued the poll schedule on December 23 and fixed January 7 as poll notification day. Senior counsel D Prakash Reddy, appearing for Uttam, had said that Telangana Municipalities Act clearly mandated that poll notification should be issued first, followed by the poll schedule.

Countering it, SEC senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said that small infractions of law should not be shown as reasons for seeking stay on elections. “The local bodies do not have elected executive and there is a constitutional mandate thrust on SEC to hold polls on time,” he said.

When the bench sought to know what harm would be done if the poll schedule release preceded poll notification — even if it was a violation of law — Uttam’s counsel pointed out that all consequent notifications issued after the release of poll schedule had reduced the time frame for various phases of works such as survey of SCs, STs & BCs and fixing reservations.

“Even for receiving objections and resolving them, the time was reduced to a mere three days from 30 days,” he said.

But the bench cited Supreme Court’s Ponnuswamy case judgment that even pre-election work should be seen as election work and, hence, could not be interfered with. “If anyone is aggrieved, they have the remedy in the form of an election petition which should be filed before an election tribunal after the poll process is over,” the bench said, before dismissing the plea.

The bench, however, issued notices to the state and SEC regarding women’s reservations in Badangpet municipal corporation and sought counters from authorities within four weeks.

Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh has witnessed a jump in Niti Aayog’s markings for sustainable development goals ( SDG ) as compared to last year, but needs to gear up on overall ranking where it is placed 24th among 28 states. As compared to 2018, UP’s score has gone up from 42 to 55.

Out of 15 goals, UP has made significant progress under most parameters but its score has fallen in three categories – ‘No Poverty, ‘Zero Hunger’ and ‘Quality Education’.

“Uttar Pradesh has improved its overall score from 42 in 2018 to 55 in 2019, and is the highest gainer. The biggest improvement has been in goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in which the jump has been by 40 points. Scores in goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), have climbed by 39 and 34 points, respectively,” the report said.

Under ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’, the state ranks second with a score of 94. UP has shown an achievement of 99.20% coverage for households with improved source of drinking water and 100% coverage of rural homes for toilets, even as the process for providing toilets to household left out of the 2012 survey is still on.

In five goals, UP ranks in bottom five states. In three goals – ‘No Poverty’, ‘Reduced Inequality’ and ‘Life on Land’ – UP is fourth last.

In ‘Zero Hunger’ goal, UP scores its lowest 31 marks to figure fifth from last. In ‘Good Health and Well Being’ goal, UP settles for 34 points to figure second last, ahead of Nagaland.

It has been marked zero for ‘Under 5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births’ which in Uttar Pradesh is 78, the highest among 28 states.

Government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told TOI: “When our government took over on March 19, 2017, it inherited a hopeless situation. However, we have been giving our best and the state has been showing constant improvement. We are working on all possibilities to ensure that soon Uttar Pradesh figures among top 10 states in ranking.”

154,['8/01/2020'],Vehicle sales lose lustre in Diamond City,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Surat: The severe downturn in the diamond industry coupled with liquidity crunch dragged down registrations of new vehicles in Surat for the third consecutive year.

Though the fall in sales in Surat was not as steep as that recorded in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Vadodara, dealers are not very optimistic about recovery soon.

The overall passenger vehicle registration in Surat dropped by 8.88% in 2019 as compared to previous year. While two-wheelers sales witnessed a reduction of around 6%, the negative effect was more in cars which saw a drop of 20.59% in 2019.

Experts and dealers said that the cash flow in diamond and textiles, the two main economic mainstays of Surat, has been stifled due to recession, which has affected the buyers sentiments.

Gaurang Joshi, transportation expert at Sardar Valalbhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) said, “The negative growth is mainly due to economic reason. Public transport ridership is stagnant at 2.3 lakh to 2.5 lakh people daily. It is not that people have turned to public transport, but they simply don’t want to afford a new vehicle.”

In textile industry, the average income of a power loom worker has come down to Rs 12,000- Rs 15,000 from Rs 25,000 and in diamond sector, it has come down from an average Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000 amonth in 2017-18 to around Rs 20,000. This has affected the luxury purchase greatly.

AHMEDABAD: Tuesday recorded 3.3 degrees and 3.9 degrees higher than average maximum and minimum temperatures. According to India meteorological department (IMD), the weather may cool down slightly by Friday.

Ahmedabad recorded 31°C and 16.7°C as maximum and minimum temperatures, forcing the citizens to shun woollens. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 16°C.

“Change in wind direction and morning’s induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood caused the weather change. In Saurashtra and Kutch, the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 2-3°C from Wednesday whereas remaining parts of the state will have to wait for two more days,” said an IMD official.

All weather stations in Gujarat recorded above 10°C minimum temperature on Tuesday with Naliya in Kutch recording 11.6°C. Surat was the hottest city with 20.2°C minimum and 31.4°C of maximum temperature.

CHANDIGARH: While the mortal remains of one of the oldest military veterans of country, Lt Gen P N Hoon (90), were consigned to flames on Tuesday, many stories about his four-decade military service remain alive. An interesting account Gen Hoon had shared a few years back was about his journey of learning golfing skills, and that too at the battlefield during the 1965 Indo-Pak war.

During one of his interactions with TOI on the 50th anniversary of 1965 Indo-Pak war in August 2015, Gen Hoon had recalled that after completing his staff college, he was posted as General Staff Officer-2 (GSO-2) with Ist armoured division based at Babina-Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh. He, being an officer from the infantry, was not accepted “wholeheartedly” by the armoured corps officers, who consider themselves “superior” and “elite”, because he was not even introduced to the game of golf at that time.

He had revealed that soon after his posting, 1965 war broke out and armoured division led by Major General Rajinder Singh Sparrow was ordered to move for Amritsar area in Punjab. As a GSO-2, Hoon was holding key responsibility of coordinating in operation room of the division and to coordinate with other troops.

He further informed that while deployed in Amritsar area, they had almost cut down the Lahore area from another part of their country but due to change of plan at the last moment, they were given marching orders to move for Sialkot area. “We left one unit at Amritsar area, which later gave a befitting reply to Pakistan’s armoured brigade that was advancing into Indian territory with Patton tanks, and given burial to most of the Pattons in the famous battle of Assal Uttar,” he had explained.

Thereafter the division moved to Zaffarwal-Pasroor area in Sialkot sector, where they occupied a considerable portion of Pakistan territory after confronting with the enemy’s troops.

The veteran had explained how they managed to occupy a huge fertile land in Sialkot area of Pakistan owing to the strategic handling of the operation by Commander Major Gen Sparrow. Gen Sparrow was later awarded Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) for his role in the 1965 war.

He had said after declaration of ceasefire, they had to stay in Pakistan area for around 15-20 days before receiving further orders and it was only then that he learnt the basics of golf.

“We used to prepare ground with waste oil of the tanks mixing with sand and play golf. It was this period of war in the battlefield that an infantry officer fined-tuned his golfing skills and brought them at par with the elite armoured corps colleagues,” Hoon had informed.

He had also informed that how a visit to the battlefield by the then prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri , was a morale booster for the troops at that time.

Cremated with military honours

Lt Gen Hoon, who had retired as army commander, Western Command, was cremated with full military honours at the Sector 25 electric crematorium on Tuesday. Lt Gen R P Singh, general officer commanding in chief (GOC-in-C), Western Command, along with other senior officers of Western Command laid floral tribute to the departed soldier. Senior INLD leader, Abhay Singh Chautala, former Army chief General N C Vij, a large number of military veterans from the Tricity and family members/relatives of Gen Hoon attended the cremation. Gen Hoon (90) had breathed his last at the Command Hospital, Chandimandir, on Monday evening. He was suffering from old age related ailments.

Shopkeepers from local shopping complexes gathered outside the office after discussing the issue at a joint me... Read More

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of traders of sealed shops gathered outside the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee’s office in south Delhi on Tuesday morning to pursue their cases for de-sealing of properties.

With the sealing drive still on a year after it began, traders said it was going to be a key issue in the run-up to the upcoming Delhi assembly elections. Shopkeepers from local shopping complexes of Defence Colony, Greater Kailash, Green Park, South Extension, Kirti Nagar and other areas had gathered after discussing the issue at a joint meeting last week.

Most of them were carrying all papers of their shops, which they claimed were ‘purely commercial’. They sought de-sealing of their shops immediately.

After long wait, the committee accepted 108 de-sealing applications. “We reached the place by 11am in huge numbers. Cops had to intervene to deal with crowd. All of us had the same question — why were we not getting relief despite amendments in the master plan and guidelines issued by the municipalities, to de-seal the shops,” said Harsh Bansal, a trader from Defence Colony market. His shop was sealed two years ago and since then he had been running his business from staircases in front of his shop.

After accepting the de-sealing applications, committee members called the traders for a meeting in the afternoon. “We told the committee members that these shops were purely commercial and not shop-cum-residence structures. We also said that the sealing were carried out as the corporation officials were themselves clueless about the norms. After hearing us, the monitoring panel members asked for a week’s time to revert,” said Rajat Arora, a trader from Kirti Nagar.

According to him, the monitoring committee has called a joint meeting with the principal secretary of the Delhi government and the three municipal commissioners on Wednesday, to discuss the matter in detail before taking any action.

Meanwhile, another 150 traders from local shopping centres were likely to apply for de-sealing of commercial shops this week, to the monitoring committee.

A monitoring committee member, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We are bound by the court’s direction and will not order de-sealing unless we get direction from the court. We have accepted their applications as routine affair and will look into the matter. However, there is no specific direction given to commissioners for meeting on this issue,” he said. He added that the traders were trying to put pressure ahead of the elections.

159,['8/01/2020'],"New launches up 176%, sales rise 3% in ’19","Ahmedabad: Real estate sector in the city seems have seen traction with jump in launches of new residential homes and improvement in sales. New home launches galloped by 176% to 11,487 new units in 2019 from 4,167 units launched in 2018, says a report released by real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank India.The jump in 2019 looks steeper because of the low base of new launches in 2018. State government decision to temporarily allow manual or offline mode of approving building plans and focus on homes costing from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 50 lakh provided a much-needed impetus to the real estate market.The year 2019 also saw sales improving by 3% with 16,713 units being sold as against 16,188 units in 2018. Although the sales growth remained moderate, the number of sales in 2019 was the highest in past four years. The prices continued to remain stagnant with 2% rise year-on-year basis, the report added.“Steady uptake of ready-to-move in or near ready residential inventory in Ahmedabad has been instrumental in sales trends maintaining a positive momentum despite the real estate sector itself undergoing a structural change in the recent past,” Balbirsingh Khalsa, branch director, Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India.With low unsold inventory, developers would be motivated to plan future residential supply to cater to the inherent residential demand in periods to come. “We can expect new launches to improve further in 2020,” he added.Apart from residential, office space witnessed 4.88 million square feet of new supply — the highest in past five years — during 2019. The supply stood 58% higher than 3.09 million sq ft in 2018. Office leasing also surged by 50% to 1.55 million sq ft. Higher supply than off-take kept the office market rents stable despite the significant rise in-office transactions, which mostly maintained the market’s competitive edge.“The office market in Ahmedabad has seen a strong growth in 2019. With the necessary physical infrastructure in place, developers are stepping in to meet the requirements of companies either moving into the city or expanding their presence in the city,” Khalsa said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-launches-up-176-sales-rise-3-in-19/articleshow/73146820.cms

Vijayawada: The high court will hear all the petitions seeking Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case on Wednesday. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Vivekananda Reddy’s wife Sowbhagya moved high court seeking CBI probe into the murder before the elections.

Former minister Adinarayana Reddy and TDP MLC BTech Ravi also moved the high court seeking CBI probe into the case after the elections. Interestingly, all the petitioners found fault with the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case.

Jaganmohan Reddy and Sowbhagya in their petitions have argued that the actions of the police and SIT were arbitrary, unconstitutional and ultra vires to the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code. They sought investigation by an independent agency, which is not under the direct control of Andhra Pradesh director general of police (DGP) and the state government.

Adinarayana Reddy and Ravi have also made a similar plea, terming the SIT investigation as ultra vires to the provisions of CrPC.

The petitions moved by Jaganmohan Reddy and Sowbhagya came for hearing before the Chief Justice bench on Tuesday. However, as the petitions by Adinarayana Reddy and Ravi are pending with a single-judge bench and scheduled for hearing on Wednesday. Chief Justice J K Maheswari tagged all the petitions together for hearing by a single judge.

Darbar has been produced by investing Rs 220 crore

CHENNAI: The Rajinikanth starrer, Darbar , scheduled to be released on January 9 can hit screens everywhere but in Malaysia, said Madras high court on Tuesday. However, if the film’s producers — Lyca Productions Private Limited — deposit Rs 4.9 crore in the court, they are free to release the movie in Malaysia too, it added.

Justice G Jayachandran passed an order to this effect, on a civil suit iled by Malaysia-based film distributor DMY Creation SDN BHD claiming Rs 23 crore dues from Lyca for distributing various Tamil movies produced by Lyca, including Kaala and 2.0. The distributor wanted the court to stall the release of Darbar.

Opposing the plea, V Ragavachari, counsel for Lyca, submitted that the suit was bereft of details, unsupported by any pleadings or documents to support the contentions. The suit based on the premise that Lyca availed itself of loan from the distributor and liable to repay was fictitious, he said. Lyca is financially sound and there is no need to avail itself of loan from the applicant, he added.

“The allegation that Lyca obtained loan from the applicant is evidently and clearly false especially considering the background and financial position of the firm. Darbar has been produced by investing Rs 220 crore and if interim injunction is granted, Lyca will be put to irreparable loss and suffering,” Raghavachari added.

This apart, injunction cannot be granted for mere asking and there must be some strong case for irreparable loss, if interim injunction not granted. The balance of convenience is more in favour of Lyca who has invested heavily in the production of the movie and had widely advertised that the movie will be released on January 9 worldwide, he argued.

Noting that though the court is convinced by the submission made by Lyca against grant of injunction, the judge said, however, under equity, the right of the applicant who has made out a prima facie case should also be protected and passed the interim order.

Vijayawada: An eight-foot-long python was rescued by forest officials near Keesara village in Krishna district on Tuesday.

Village youths managed to capture the snake after some locals noticed it, and notified forest officials who reached the spot and rescued the reptile. Forest officials stated that python sightings in the area have become frequent. Usually, pythons in the region are found in hilly areas or in the Krishna estuary.

The recent floods in the Krishna has altered the habitat of snakes across the district, said forest officials, leading areas adjacent to the river — such as Vijayawada, Avanigadda, Nandigama and Kanchikacherla — become a breeding ground for the reptiles. The python would soon be released into the reserve forest area, said officials.

Nagpur: The Kuhi judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), DU Rajput, has acquitted mining entrepreneur Anil Ramchandra Bhable in the infamous case of 2013 about quarrying on protected forest land in Pachgaon, 20km from Nagpur.

Bhable, who faced trial for over 6.5 years, was booked under various sections of the Indian Forest Act , 1927 and Forest Conservation Act , 1980 . TOI was the first to report violations of FCA by the mining industry in Pachgaon. The report created a storm.

Some top officials have been issued charge sheets in the case and cases have even been registered against the forest staff who turned a blind eye towards illegal mining.

In the present case, on December 4, 2012, during survey, the forest department had charged Bhable with encroaching upon 3.80-hectare forest land and excavating murrum in survey number 256.

Accordingly, a preliminary offence was registered against Bhable, who was arrested and goods and machinery worth crores were seized from his premises. He was also charged with causing royalty loss of Rs2.75 crore to the government.

Since the start of the case, Bhable pleaded innocence and alleged that he was falsely implicated as he did not succumb to the demands by foresters. During trial, all the forest officials who were involved in the process were cross-examined.

However, the forest department failed to prove that Bhable’s Om Construction Company quarried stones and removed forest produce. They also could not prove that the said firm encroached upon forest land.

RB Gaikwad, counsel for Bhable, argued that the forest department did not examine any independent witnesses and all the witnesses were forest employees.

To prove the charge of alleged encroachment, no land record officers were summoned. Besides, no proper procedure for measurement was followed.

Mehak Mirza Prabhu holds a poster reading 'Free Kashmir' in Mumbai during a protest against the violence at J... Read More

MUMBAI: The Colaba police on Tuesday evening filed an FIR against Mehak Mirza Prabhu, the woman protester at the Gateway whose placard reading ‘ Free Kashmir ’ kicked up a storm with ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis and others alleging that the agitation in support of JNU students had taken on a divisive character.

Mehak was booked under Section 153B of the IPC for imputations and assertions prejudicial to national integration. No arrest has been made. Conviction attracts jail for a maximum of five years.

The FIR was filed suo motu by Colaba police. It came after home minister Anil Deshmukh of the NCP said that the state would probe the matter and after Shiv Sena and NCP leaders had defended Mehak. She sought to clarify her position in a video she put out on social media and in a chat with TOI, saying she was speaking only of “basic constitutional rights” and “freedom of expression” in J&K in view of the “internet shutdown” there.

Responding to Fadnavis’s tweet on the matter, NCP’s water resources minister Jayant Patil tweeted: “Devendraji It’s ‘free Kashmir’ from all discriminations, bans on cellular networks and central control. I can’t believe that responsible leader like you trying (sic) to confuse people by decoding words in such a hatred way. Is it losing power or losing self-control.”

A senior police officer said they would examine Mehak’s profile on social media. “We have to scan all the information about her in order to establish in what context she was carrying the poster,” an IPS officer said on Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking about what she termed as the “abuse, hate and narrative” that the image of her holding up the poster had spawned, Mehak told TOI, “I have been in too much distress. I’m an artiste, I tell stories and I was there like everyone else with no other agenda. I did not write or create that poster. It was lying around, which I happened to lift and hold up.”

In her 3.26-minute video on social media, she said her intentions had been “misinterpreted”. She said, “Yesterday, on January 6th, around 7pm, I reached where the protest was happening at the Gateway of India . Like anybody else who believes in democracy, I also joined the protest. There were groups of people singing songs and raising slogans about various issues. We were there to demand justice for JNU students, but as I moved around, I saw people painting placards on everything from NRC, CAA, JNU students... that’s when I noticed a placard lying around that read ‘Free Kashmir’. The first thought that came to my mind was the fact that we were there to demand basic constitutional rights and knowing about the Internet shutdown over the past five months in Kashmir, I felt that people there deserved the freedom to express themselves like us too. In fact, I held a flower in my hand too as an offering of peace.”

Stating that things had been “blown out of proportion” and she had been labelled as a “member of a gang,” the 37-year-old stressed on her background as a Maharashtrian and a storytelling artiste. “The picture created by social media came as an absolute shock to me,” she said. “If by being naive in understanding the impact it would have, and in the process (having) created this stir, I apologise. As a woman it is scary for my safety. Itna darr ke jeena humey nahi chahiyein.”

She told TOI her friend and creative partner Mohammad Muneem, a Kashmiri singer-songwriter, had no role to play in her act of holding up the placard and that he was away in Pune on Monday.

Earlier in the day, home minister Anil Deshmukh said, “We will check the protester’s antecedents. If she is found to have a history of creating nuisance and her intentions were anti-national, action will be taken,”

Sena parliamentary party leader Sanjay Raut said, “I read in the newspaper that those who held the ‘Free Kashmir’ banner clarified they want to be free of restrictions on internet services, mobile services and other issues.” However, he added that “if anyone talks of freedom of Kashmir from India, it will not be tolerated.” Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted, “Apart from that incident look at larger picture, yes we need to see her intent, was it to remove internet blockade, if it was freeing Kashmir from India then it’s wrong. Obviously everyone condemned it, not even other protesters supported it.”

Ex-BJP MP Kirit Somaiya said, “Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut endorsed the anti-India ‘Kashmir ko chahiye Azadi’ protest at Gateway of India. Does Sena want Article 370 in Kashmir again? How many compromises will Sena bear for power?”

Box

Apart from the FIR against Mehak Mirza Prabhu, three other cases were registered by the police on Tuesday evening in connection with Monday’s protests over the JNU violence . Two FIRs were filed for unlawful assembly against JNU student leader Umar Khalid and other activists and one was lodged against members of the Akhil Bharti Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) for unlawful assembly. No one has been arrested.

AHMEDABAD: Tabla maestro Yogesh Samsi was joined by mridangam stalwart Anantha Krishna on Day 6 of Saptak, on Monday. In the drumroll introducing the festival’s unforgettable moments, Samsi’s presence will resound often. For instance, the percussive cushions he provided for Pandit Birju Maharaj in 2011 is still remembered by Saptak old-timers. Samsi himself is self-effacing. Therefore, it was gratifying for rasikas to see him at the centre of the stage on Monday.Anantha Krishna’s mridangam passages clarified both the silences and emphases of Samsi’s account. The collaboration recalled one of the best Hindustani-Carnatic alliances on the Saptak stage, which was evidenced in 2013. That performance brought together Dhrupad grandees Pandits Ramakant and Umakant Gundecha and Carnatic notables Shriramkumar Malladi and Ravikumar Malladi.“Bhava, raga, taala sumadhura sangeetam, brahmananda dayakam” (music, with feeling and euphony, offers bliss) was the finale of the quartet. Malladis’ flourish — as extravagant as wedding jewellery — lay encased in the Gundechas’ austere chants. The contrast was so startling that many in the audience sprang to their feet to applaud when the recital dipped into periods of momentary silence.On Monday, Samsi and Anantha Krishna were accompanied by Bangalore Amrit on the khanjira and Tanmay Deochake on the harmonium. Deochake opened the presentation with a solo foray. The spell of contemplation smoothed the start of a new day. As is often the case, Saptak’s final baithak had slipped past midnight.Earlier on Monday, the programme had featured kathakar Vishal Krishna and vocalist Kaivalya Kumar. The expansiveness of the schedule pleased rasikas. They had been initially disappointed with the cancellation of Pandit Shivkumar Sharma’s recital. The santoor icon had fallen ill. Incidentally, Samsi was to accompany Pandit Sharma.Kafi: ‘Kaali Ghodi Dwar Khadi’ of “Chashme Buddoor” rides on this ragaListener's Glossary:Dhrupad: Combination of ‘Dhruva’, signifying ‘fixed’; and ‘pada’, or ‘verse’.Today’s events:1) Shri Amaan Ali Bangash – Sarod2) Pt.

CHANDIGARH: The decision to rename Manimajra as Sector 13 has been challenged in the district court while citing its historical importance and sentiments of the people attached to the name.Lawyers for Humanity, an NGO, has filed a petition against the UT administration, deputy commissioner and Resident Welfare Association of Modern Housing Complex, Manimajra, seeking the authorities be restrained from changing the name.The matter would come up for hearing on Wednesday.The petition mentioned that Manimajra is a historical town situated in the foothills of Shivalik range, established 600 years ago by its then ruler Gharib Dass. The petition said Manimajra witnessed many historical events and has a 600-year-old fort. It also has a social and religious importance as the ‘Sidh peeth’ of Mansa Devi temple is situated in the periphery of Manimajra, the petition said.Manimajra has a historical gurudwara, Mata Raj Kaur Gurdwara, situated in the fort. The petition said Gurdwara Khooni Sahib in Manimajra has a historical background as Guru Gobind Singh had visited the place. Manimajra also has a ‘Thakurdwara’, which is 500 to 600 years old. It was built by the rulers of the area and is dedicated to Rama, Hanuman and Sita.The petition said the authorities are ignoring the facts and sentiments of local people. Advocate Ravinder Bassi said the original inhabitants of the town are against the move, while only a few people hailing from other places are in its favour.The petition said the name change would hurt the sentiments and feelings of the people of the locality as well as other devotees of religious places situated in the town.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73147391,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-741987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/manimajra-as-sector-13-move-challenged-in-court/articleshow/73146784.cms

LUCKNOW: A day after an undertrial in a triple murder case allegedly shot himself using a countrymade pistol in the presence of police in Mainpuri district court, police on Tuesday arrested his wife and seven policemen for criminal conspiracy. 3 other cops have been suspended and slapped with a show cause notice.

The murder case accused, 30-year-old Manish along with Kallu and Jitendra were produced in the court of Additional District Judge-IV, Tarun Kumar Singh for hearing in the 2012 triple murder case on Monday. Police said that Manish, in connivance with Kallu and Jitendra, had on October 9, 2012 shot dead his father Sukhram, stepmother Sushma Devi and brother Abhishek over a property dispute under Karhal police station area of the district.

During the hearing in the case, when Manish was asked to personally explain the circumstances on the day of the crime by appearing in the court, he took out a countrymade weapon and shot at his right foot. Manish was sent to district hospital for treatment and later arrested again.

On Tuesday, CO (Mainpuri city) Abhay Narayan Singh said Manish, in his statement to the police, had said that the pistol was given to him by his sister’s husband Prince. However, gunshot residue samples and fingerprints were taken from the 312 bore countrymade pistol Manish had used. “We questioned each member separately and also asked them to undergo lie-detector tests to sort out the case,” said Singh. Manish’s wife Seema Yadav broke down and disclosed she had hidden the pistol she got from brother Vinod in her clothes and had passed it on to her husband. A case was filed against Seema and she was arrested. The CO said efforts were on to arrest Vinod. Two inspectors, two male constables, a woman constable and two local intelligence constables have also been arrested.

Surat: A 13-year-old student suffered a fracture in skull when he was hit by an arrow while playing on the ground of Poddar International School here on Saturday. The boy was operated upon at a private hospital on Monday but remains serious, his father said.

Tejas Dadhich, a student of class VIII of Podar International School, Sarthana was hit by an arrow in head. He collapsed on ground and immediately shifted to a private hospital by school authorities.

“I received a call from the school authorities that my son had suffered an injury and is admitted to a private hospital. His skull was fractured and condition serious and hence I shifted him to a hospital which specializes in neurological surgeries,” said Manoj, father of Tejas.

“I was told by the school authorities that Tejas was playing in one portion of the ground while in the adjoining some students were practising archery. By chance, an arrow crossed a six-foot wall and hit Tejas in head. I just want my son to return home safe without any health issues,” said Manoj, a textile businessman.

Meanwhile, hospital authorities alerted cops and they registered statement of the boy. However, so far no case has been registered. “I am not aware about the incident, but will inquire what exactly had happened,” said T R Chaudhary, police inspector, Sarthana police station.

“I am not aware if the school is under my jurisdiction. If it is not, then it is not our responsibility to look into the matter,” said H H Rajyaguru, district education officer, Surat.

“The school is shocked by the accident that involved two students engaged in sports activities on campus. The school is working together with officials of education department to ensure such an incident is not repeated in future,” said B D Kotwani, principal of Podar International School.

170,['8/01/2020'],JNU violence: Gateway protest melts away at Azad Maidan,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Demonstrators after being shited to Azad Maidan on Tuesday

MUMBAI: After over 34 hours of spontaneous sloganeering, chants and creative posters at the Gateway of India against the brutal violence at JNU , the protesters were pushed to Azad Maidan , the city’s designated protest area, early on Tuesday. Soon after, the students called off the #OccupyGateway protest and dispersed. Some of them have extended support to Wednesday’s bandh.

Four FIRs were filed in the evening against the protesters, but no arrests have been made.

Members of several organisations met on Tuesday evening to review the sit-in protest and plan ahead. “We were reviewing the logistics and coordination during the protest at Gateway to ensure that further programmes are smooth. We will continue the month-long schedule of protests,” said Bilal Khan, one of those who attended the meeting.

What had started as an impromptu protest around midnight on Sunday saw thousands of students and citizens join in throughout Monday. A few hundred stayed back on Monday night as well. “We had a very exciting night at Gateway, where we continued chanting and we were going to sing the national anthem around 6.30am when the police came and asked us to move to Azad Maidan. Some of us tried to reason with the cops but it was futile. Soon, the police began pushing people into their vans and drove them to Azad Maidan,” said a protester.

The police said they kept telling the protesters prohibitory orders had been imposed, but they refused to listen. They did not want to take action against women at night and so moved them in the morning. As many as 600 police personnel were deployed between Gateway and Azad Maidan. “They were inconveniencing the public and we also received complaints of traffic jam at Gateway,” said an officer after shifting the protesters to Azad Maidan.

Those shifted claimed they were not allowed to leave immediately. “The police wanted an assurance that we would not return to Gateway. After lawyers helped us out, we were allowed to go but only after recording details and verifying identity cards,” said the protester. “We took down their names, contact details and information about their identity cards, if available. It is to ensure transparency on those protesting at the maidan and to record that they left. If someone says he was beaten up by cops, we have a person’s identity and it would be easier to verify it,” said the officer.

Social media was buzzing on Tuesday morning with messages requesting protesters to convene again at Gateway and Azad Maidan, but the protesters clarified they had called off #OccupyGateway. “Since the protest at Gateway was spontaneous, there was not a lot of coordination. Hence we decided to disperse, plan and continue our protest,” said Akshay Sawant, an IIT-Bombay student and member of the Joint Action Committee, which extended support to the Bharat Bandh on Wednesday.

As the crowds thinned at Azad Maidan around noon, several volunteers were seen packing excess supplies like food, blankets, sanitary napkins, etc which citizens had donated. “We will send it back to NGOs or shelter homes where they can be used. The perishable items are being given out to the ongoing protests,” said a student.

Nearly 200 students, faculty and alumni from IIT-B carried out a demonstration on the second consecutive day in solidarity with the JNU students. In Malad, a few ABVP members gathered on Tuesday morning to condemn “the violence perpetrated by Leftist goons in JNU”. Members said they were planning to hold similar protests in the city over the next few days.

Mumbai police and DCP Sangram Singh Nishandar were feted on social media for their calm handling of the protests. Actor Sonam Kapur tweeted, “Thank you @Mumbaipolice for your patience and doing your job. All my friends who attended the protests are all praises. It makes my heart swell in pride.”

BENGALURU: A startup that sprouted here amid unfortunate circumstances nine years ago bagged the ‘Best Startup of Pride of India Expo’ award at Indian Science Congress, 2020, on Tuesday.In 2011, lakhs of textile workers in Tamil Nadu lost their jobs following a Supreme Court order shutting down factories for discharging effluents into rivers. The water pollution that pushed lakhs of people into joblessness also inspired scientists — Dr SCG Kiruba Daniel, Suthanthira Daniel and their colleagues — to find something to stop the hazard at the source, at a lower cost and with lesser effort. Thus came into existence Nanosolution, the brainchild of their venture JK Solutions , which was launched in Bengaluru in 2017 and incubated at IISc.Nanosolution is a liquid-based solution consisting of metal nanoclusters which, on being introduced in polluted water, draws foreign particles and sinks to the bottom as organic sludge. The founders claim the method recovers 98% of water. It is at work in BMTC and three dhobi ghats — including at Vyalikaval and Srinagar — where it treats and recycles around 1.5 lakh litres of wastewater everyday.Daniel said one litre of the solution can treat 1,000 to 2,000 litres of wastewater. “The nanotechnology-based product is a simple, one-step, rapid, low-cost solution,” he said, adding that treatment costs up to Rs 1.30 per litre, one-tenth of the regular cost. JK Solutions claims to have treated over 10 million litres of water for reuse since its inception.VP: Inventions can ward off threat to food safetyThe solution to the growing threat to food security lies in novel ideas, inventions and efforts by the scientific community, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said in his valedictory speech at ISC on Tuesday.Stressing the need to inculcate morals along with science among schoolkids, he said: “When we were young, we had moral science classes. Today, science continues, while morals have vanished,” Naidu said. He said people should “go online, instead of standing in a line”.“People will stand in a line, shake hands and do much more (grease palms).

Jaipur: The North Western Railway will provide bedrolls to all passengers travelling in the Jaipur-Chandigarh Garib Rath from May 15.

Abolishing the previous system of optional bedrolls, the NWR will provide it to all passengers for a few extra bucks which will be added to the fare. For a long time, railway authorities had been getting complaints of chaos in the train during distribution of bedrolls in Jaipur-Chandigarh Garib Rath since it was handled by private vendors.

There are also complaints of overcharging, poor linen and rush while the vendor used to distribute the bedrolls.

In other trains, bedroll costs are included in the ticket fares. “Currently, people travelling in Jaipur-Chandigarh Garib Rath are required to pay Rs 25 per bedroll. With the new system, the charges for the bedroll would be deducted in the ticket itself and every passenger will get one in the train,” said a senior officer of NWR. NWR chief public relations officer Abhay Sharma said, “The facility will be available for passengers from May 15 onwards. While travelling in Jaipur-Chandigarh and Chandigarh-Jaipur Garib Rath, all passengers will get bedrolls. It has now been made compulsory for all. Earlier, passengers were facing difficulties.” Sharma said those who had already booked tickets in advance, cannot avail this facility.

Madras HC

CHENNAI: The Centre on Tuesday informed the Madras high court that the Tamil Nadu government’s proposal to release seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, including Nalini Sriharan, has been rejected by it in April 2018 since it would lead to “international ramifications”.

Additional solicitor general G Rajagopalan made the submission on behalf of the home ministry on the plea moved by Nalini seeking to declare her detention as illegal since the governor had failed to act upon the recommendation of the state cabinet to release the seven convicts.

Recording the submissions, a division bench of Justice R Subbiah and Justice R Pongiyappan impleaded the Union home ministry as party respondent and directed it to file a counter by January 28.

In the rejection order produced by the solicitor general, the home ministry had stated: ‘The case involves assassination of a former prime minister of the country who was brutally killed in pursuance of diabolical plot carefully conceived and executed by a highly organised foreign terrorist organisation. Sixteen innocent lives were lost and many sustained grievous injuries in the gruesome, inhuman, uncivilised, and merciless bomb blast which was successfully enacted with active help and participation of these convicts and others who were LTTE militants or its staunch supporters.”

“The CBI has opposed the state government’s proposal to release the convicts in the interest of justice. The case has been reviewed, scrutinised by various forums of the judiciary and executive and both the highest judicial forum as well as the executive forum has elevated the case and decided the matter. Releasing the four foreign nationals who had committed the gruesome murder of former PM in connivance with three Indian nationals will set a very dangerous precedent and lead to international ramifications by other such criminals in the future,” the order said.

AHMEDABAD: A woman was beaten for demanding sex from her husband, who claims to have taken up celibacy. Her in-laws also allegedly thrashed her when they found out about the issue. A complaint in this regard was filed at the Women’s police station (east) against the husband and in-laws, under the Domestic Violence Act on Monday.

In her FIR, the woman, 22, a resident of Danilimda , states that she married with a man from Sarkhej , who is now 25, on May 14, 2016. Initially, her husband’s behaviour towards her was decent but changed after she delivered their first child in 2018.

“For the past few months, my husband had stopped having sex with me. Whenever I asked for it, he got furious and beat me,” states the complainant, adding that her husband claims to have adopted celibacy.

When she insisting on having sex, her husband left their house. Due to this, her in-laws began harassing and beating her, saying she had forced him to leave.

The woman states that her husband was in stress due over money he had borrowed from various moneylenders, and had even stopped caring for her and their child.

“A few months ago, when my son had a severe infection in his intestine, my husband did not even pay for medicines,” she states in the FIR.

The woman had on Monday approached police and filed a complaint for domestic violence and abetment against her husband and four of her in-laws. The accused have not yet been arrested.

New Delhi: Two more people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the clashes that broke out in north-east Delhi’s Seelampur during the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act in December.

Nineteen people, including five Bangladeshi immigrants , were arrested earlier for allegedly throwing stones, damaging public properties and setting buses on fire. The accused arrested on Wednesday have been identified as Shehzad (23) and Noor Mohammad (19).

DCP Rajesh Deo said the men were identified and arrested through an electronic surveillance system and after analysing the videos of the clashes. “Shehzad was found to be a notorious history sheeter of Seelampur involved in many criminal cases. Noor has no criminal record,” he said. Noor had recorded some videos and pictures of the violence on his mobile phone and both were also seen throwing stones in a CCTV footage, a source claimed.

A special investigation team (SIT) identified both of them while scanning the CCTV footage from the area. The team got some blurry images, which were enhanced to identify the subjects.

The cops claimed that all five Bangladeshi immigrants had been staying in JJ colonies in the Delhi border areas illegally. SIT is now looking into the funding of the protest and trying to find out if any foreign source was involved.

177,['8/01/2020'],EWS norms different for RTE &amp; higher edu institutes,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Jaipur: The state government is in a fix over setting different criteria for economically weaker sections (EWS) for admissions under Right to Education (RTE) Act and 10% quota for general category EWS in higher educational institutes and government jobs. The EWS criteria under RTE is Rs 1 lakh annual income, while for those seeking reservation in higher educational institutes and government jobs, it is Rs 8 lakh per annum.

The RTE Act section 2 (E) empowers state to determine the income limit for EWS category for the purpose of 25% admissions in the private schools. Exercising its powers, state determined Rs 1 lakh for EWS category in the last two years. This is the only benefit under the EWS category till the advent of 10% reservation quota for general category EWS introduced in 2018.

The issue surfaced after Constitution (103rd Amendment Act) Act, 2019 introduced 10% reservation for the EWS for the admission in government educational institutions and employment in the public services. The income eligibility thereupon has been settled at Rs 8 lakh/annum along with other criteria. Thereafter, state government on October 20 made Rs 8 lakh annual income, the sole criteria to avail EWS reservation in Rajasthan.

A delegation of RTE activists has uprised the CMO officials highlighting the complexities of having two definitions for one subject, on Tuesday. “The two disparate definitions of EWS Section in a state is a breach of reasonable classification under Article 14 of the Indian constitution and led to ambiguity in the public policy. By law, two definitions cannot stand legal scrutiny. Government has no choice other than taking raising the income limit to Rs 8 lakh for EWS for RTE,” said Pranjal Singh, president of Abhyutthanam Society, who submitted his representation to CMO officials. “During the meeting with principal secretary to CM Kuldeep Ranka and special secretary to CM Aarti Dogra, the legal implications of the two definitions have been explained. They have assured to take affirmative action on my plea,” said Singh.

The issue has started being discussed within the education department officials and at CM level. This is the time of the year, state frames rules and guidelines for the RTE admissions. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra feels that any rise in the income limit will defeat the purpose of the RTE act. “Rs 8 lakh for EWS criteria for RTE admissions will invite vast number of applications and those deserving will be left behind. The issue is being discussed with CM Ashok Gehlot. Hoping to find a reasonable solution soon,” said Dotasra.

The maximum enthusiasm among voters was seen in Mouda and Kuhi talukas, which witnessed over 60% polling by 3.30pm. The figure for Mouda taluka was 62.42% while that of Kuhi was 62.51%. Against this Nagpur Rural taluka, which has a lot of semi-urban areas witnessed only 41.78% voting.

Anjana Wakde (95) voted at the polling booth at Kolbaswami junior college, Dhapewada. She told the media that she had voted in every election since she was 21 (the previous minimum age for voting). Mira Bagde, a 70-year-old physically challenged woman, voted at Pipla village in the afternoon. She came with her family members in a car.

Each voter had to cast two votes – one for ZP member and one for PS member. Such type of multiple voting is now common in local body elections.

Counting will be held at 13 tehsil offices. Some 2,000 government staffers have been deployed for counting duty. There will be 16 EVMs on each counting table. As the same EVM contained list of ZP and PS candidates, the counting process is simpler this time and is expected to be faster.

The first result is expected by 12 noon. By around noon results of 13 ZP circles and 26 PS will be declared. As one round will take two hours the final tally will be known between 6pm and 8pm.

Akola ZP witnessed around 56% voting. Most seats are witnessing quadrangular fight between Congress-NCP , Shiv Sena, BJP and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). The VBA’s earlier avatar BRP-BMS has been in power in Akola ZP since years. This time another government may come to power.

Washim ZP witnessed around 65% voting. There is no alliance between Congress and NCP in this district. The fight here too is quadrangular between Congress, NCP, BJP and Sena.

“We requested the court that the government be asked to come out with a reply on what was the exact number of deaths, causes of these deaths and what steps were taken with regard to fixing responsibility,” said amicus curiae Rajvendra Saraswat.

The court not just admitted the prayer of the amicus curiae, it also sought reply about the posts of doctors and other staff lying vacant in the hospitals and how treatment of patients was being carried out with shortage of staff, if any.

The HC also gave directions to the government to computerize district hospitals so that the record of each patient could be maintained, which would be helpful in obtaining correct data.

CHANDIGARH: If you are residing in the area falling under the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and have applied for an arms licence in the UT, be ready for a detailed verification by the forest and wildlife department too.

UT chief wildlife warden Debendra Dalai has issued directions to its staff to visit applicant’s house personally if one is residing in the ESZ area, and check his background before issuing the NOC for the arms licence.

Three villages of Chandigarh — Khuda Ali Sher, Kishangarh and Kaimbwala — come under the ESZ.

Dalai said the forest department team will check whether the person has any case in the past related to wildlife act or not. The exercise is aimed to protect wildlife sanctuary, he added.

In Chandigarh, an applicant applies at the deputy commissioner’s office for arms licence and NOC is required from UT police department and chief wildlife warden.

Dalai said they are also pushing for early declaration of eco sensitive zone (ESZ) by the Punjab and Haryana governments as well.

Till date, the Union ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has issued final notification on ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh alone while Punjab and Haryana have not declared such zones in their respective territories. The UT is pushing that Punjab and Haryana should also follow in its footsteps as it has declared area varying from 2km to 2.75km from the sanctuary boundary as ESZ.

The administration in past had opposed the Punjab government’s proposal. In a letter written to the Union government on July 25, 2014, the UT had stated that Punjab’s limit of 100 metres is very small and more so specially when the areas adjoining Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary in Punjab are being developed as high density area in Nagar Panchayat Nayagaon municipal area and therefore, had recommended that at least 1 km distance should be notified as ESZ for the area falling in Punjab.

Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot will become the longest serving (uninterrupted) PCC chief of the state on Wednesday. He equalled the record of veteran Congress leader Late Parasram Maderna on Tuesday. Pilot will complete six years on January 21.

He assumed the post of PCC president on January 21, 2014 replacing Dr Chandraban after the party suffered its worst ever electoral defeat in the assembly polls in 2013. The party was reduced to just 21 seats in the 200-member house.

It was, however, not a cake walk for the young leader who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Dausa in 2004 at the age of 26, which his father and Late Union minister Rajesh Pilot represented.

The Congress lost all the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. Sachin, who was a minister in the UPA government, lost his Lok Sabha seat of Ajmer in 2014.

The party under his leadership took on the BJP hitting the streets raising public issues. The Congress was able to defeat the ruling party in all the bypolls except Dholpur. The defeat of the ruling party in Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha seats and Mandalgarh assembly seat had set the tone for the assembly elections in December 2018.

He is credited with reviving a moribund party to take on the might of the BJP. The result was for everybody to see with the party bouncing back to power in the state. Sachin, elected to the assembly from Tonk and a claimant to the top job in the state, had to satisfy with the post of deputy chief minister under Ashok Gehlot as the party decided in favour of experience over youth.

The latest challenge for this MBA from the prestigious Wharton School in the US is the upcoming panchayat elections in the state.

Representative image

JAIPUR: The government is set to ink an agreement with NTPC for developing a 925 megawatt solar park in Jaisalmer that would fetch nearly Rs 4,000 core investment. The ultra-mega solar park at Nokh, spread over 1850 hectare, will be the first project for developing a park under the new solar policy announced last month.

Sources in the RRECL said that discussions and decisions with NTPC have taken a definite shape for developing the Nokh Ultra Mega Solar Park and an agreement is likely to be signed very soon.

When TOI contacted RRECL chairman Ajitabh Sharma, he confirmed that the discussions with NTPC are at an advanced stage and the Central PSU is very keen to develop the park for which land has already been in possession.

“We have already had several rounds of discussions with NTPC and they have shown willingness to develop the park. While we have ticked most of the boxes, which are critical to the project, they are a couple of aspects that need to be finalized by NTPC. We are expecting the process to be over very soon for the MoU to be signed,” added Sharma.

Sharma said the park will have capacity to attract projects worth nearly Rs 4,000 crore and it will generate large number of employment in the region, engaging vendors, contractors and other service providers.

In the new solar policy that aims to achieve a target of 30,000 MW solar power projects, RRECL has laid emphasis on setting up Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks in joint venture. RRECL is currently in discussion with three other Central public sector enterprises (CPSUs) to develop joint venture projects in the state.

Sharma said RRECL has already had preliminary discussions with Power Finance Corporation, Solar Energy Corporation of India, and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation for developing solar parks. “We will continue to have discussions with the CPSUs for developing new solar parks as they will play an important part in achieving the 30,000 megawatt target by 2024-25 as outlined in the policy,” added Sharma.

In fact, on December 19 last year when the solar policy was announced, Reliance Industries proposed to put up 200 MW capacity solar plant. Recently, Eden Renewables and Adani group have proposed to invest Rs 2,072 crore in the renewable power sector and both the projects have been given 100% exemption from stamp duty and conversion charges under the new RIPS.

As per the proposals, Eden Renewables will set up 300 MW solar energy project with an investment of Rs 1,572 crore in the 3716 bigha land. Similarly, Adani Group has proposed a 50 MW project for wind energy having investment of Rs 500 crore.

The Mumbai region saw its best office space absorption of 9.7 million sq ft in 2019 compared to 7.9 million sq ft the year before, but was overtaken by Hyderabad, said the India Real Estate report released by Knight Frank India.The office space market received a boost due to demand from a few sectors like information technology (IT) and banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), said Knight Frank executive director Gulam Zia.While apartment sales remained stagnant in India, Mumbai region took a much bigger hit, with sales plummeting by 14% in the second half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. In 2018, 2.42 lakh units were sold in the country, and it increased by just over 3,500 units (2.45 lakh), said the report. “The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has been hugely negative, along with Pune, among the top eight cities”, said Zia. “In 2018, we had 31,481 units selling in MMR, but only 27,212 sold last year.” The prices of apartments in MMR continued to correct, but marginally. The weighted average prices were down 2% since 2018, and by 14% from the peak of 2016.Expectedly, office space consumption was the highest at 15.3 million sq ft in 2019 in Bengaluru, compared to 13.4 million in the previous year. But it was Hyderabad that saw the highest jump of 82% (12.8 million last year compared to 7 million in 2018).In the domestic segment, developers continued to launch compact homes to get the ticket size right. Over five years between 2014 and 2019, the average size of apartments has shrunk by 25%, said the report.Affordable houses continued to dominate launches in MMR with 61% of new offers in the second half of 2019 coming under Rs 75 lakh. “The Thane market recorded the highest growth of new launches — up 36% year-on-year,” said the report.Apart from reduction in base prices, several freebies such as no floor rise, two-year free maintenance, free clubhouse membership, GST waivers, assured two-year rental schemes continue to remain in the market.

Representative image

MUMBAI: Mumbai railways in 2019 witnessed the least accidental deaths in the past five years. Nearly 2,700 commuters were killed last year, which is 19% lower than fatalities recorded in 2015. But the fact that the figure is in thousands means that efforts to minimise deaths have to continue on a war-footing, experts said.

Men formed 89% of the casualties in 2019, while track-crossing was the biggest killer. Over 1,400 commuters were killed crossing tracks , a penal offence, but efforts, such as building boundary walls and using concertina wire, seem to have worked as track-crossing deaths dropped by 10%, compared to 2018. Over 600 died after falling off locals last year. Railways said this will reduce as more closed-door AC locals are operated.

“Western Railway has four AC rakes, and three are in the offing. Seven swap rakes, which can run as AC and non-AC, are in the pipeline too,” said Ravindra Bhakar, chief public relations officer, WR.

Central Railway received its first AC local last month and six are in the pipeline this year.

Kalyan GRP post, which covers Kalyan-Kasara and Kalyan-Badlapur belts, recorded 331 deaths, which is the highest.

On WR, Borivli post, which covers Dahisar-Ram Mandir belt, had most casualties (241). “The population in the extended suburbs of Kalyan, Badlapur and Ambernath has expanded rapidly, but there is no alternative means of affordable and efficient transport developed for them to reach Mumbai, except railways,” said activist Subhash Gupta, a National Railway Users’ Consultative Council member.

Trespassing deaths have reduced as more foot over-bridges are being constructed. “Some have been shut for long, as they are dilapidated, but no alternative has come up nearby. This must be looked into by railways,” added Gupta. Reducing gaps between platforms and rakes helped reduce fatalities too, experts said.

The impact of railway mishaps is so great that it can be impossible to identify an individual killed. At least 24% commuters killed last year could not be identified. “We have a Shodh website, where photos of unknown victims are posted,” said a police officer.

MADURAI: In a press release, Dindigul district collector M Vijayalakshmi has said that cradle baby scheme was implemented in the state in 1999 in Salem to prevent female infanticide and later extended to other districts including Madurai, Dindigul and Theni in 2001.

There was a time when parents thought of their female children as a burden and used to abandon them or resorted to killing them. It was then that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa launched the cradle baby scheme through the department of social welfare to protect the children.

All these children are admitted to government homes. Many of them are adopted, but a handful of them remain there. These remaining few are pursuing their higher education and schooling. In 2001, four female infants were brought under this scheme, and one of them is pursuing her medical education, while another is doing her post-graduation and two others industrial training courses.

The district received seven male infants under the scheme from 2002 to 2003 who are studying in school. Similarly, 21 children, including 16 girls were received during 2004-2005, and all of them are studying in school.

Last year, the district received three cradle babies who were abandoned in different parts of the district, which includes a female infant. The government provides a sum of Rs 2,000 per month for the education and other needs of the children in the homes.

193,['8/01/2020'],Official apathy leaves BSNL customers sans 4G access,"This story is from January 8, 2020

MANGALURU: The Dakshina Kannada BSNL network for Mangaluru city is 4G ready, but officials are not. All it requires is 15 minutes to switch over from 3G to 4G, but officials have been reluctant to flip the switch.

BSNL officials here have been pushing deadlines for 4G services in a manner that customers are facing a situation similar to the Pumpwell flyover issue, with deadlines being extended four times for 4G rollout by BSNL. The last deadline to be missed was on January 5. Interestingly, the service is already up and running in 13 towers from Ucchila in Udupi district to Mukka near Surathkal, about 24 km from here.

Sources said that 151 towers in the Mangaluru area have were converted to 4G technology a fortnight ago, but officials at the helm of affairs are reluctant to switch on the services for some inexplicable reason.

BSNL has already reformed the 2,100MHz spectrum band, used for 3G, to strengthen its 4G network. The telecom operator is deploying L900 technology in the 2,100MHz band to complement its 4G services. When activated, 4G services would be seamlessly available from Uchila till Nethravathi Bridge in Mangaluru, for a distance of about 50 km and till Farangipete on the Mangaluru-Bengaluru National Highway. Beyond 4G connectivity, the services would automatically switch over to 3G services when the customers move out of the 4G range. Rollout of the service in the district is expected by April 2020.

BSNL Dakshina Kannada general manager G R Ravi admitted the 4G network was in place, and that they were waiting for all subscribers to change their 3G sim cards to 4G sims. When asked, isn’t it a tall order considering that BSNL has been repeatedly announcing customers to get their sims changed since August last year, Ravi said they will take a decision on the rollout soon as permission from the main office was received. “We will decide on a date soon and inform our subscribers,’’ he said.

But officials involved with 4G conversion are fuming since the network is ready, and what needs to be is just a switch over, which hardly takes 15 minutes. “When a telecom major changed from 3G to 4G a few years back, it did not even have 20% of the subscriber base change their sims to 4G. What are we waiting for? These kind of ham-handed decisions are hurting BSNL’s prospects,’’ said the source, who is closely working on the technology conversion. Once 4G services are available, customers who do not get 3G services will automatically change their sim cards, said an official, adding that sim cards were given for free in case the customer presented the old 3G sim, which would otherwise cost Rs 50. As on January 5, the 3G sim conversion to 4G was at 35% in Mangaluru and 37% in the areas from Uchila to Mukka.

194,['8/01/2020'],Sachin Pilot longest serving PCC president in Rajasthan,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot will become the longest serving (uninterrupted) PCC chief of the state on Wednesday. He equalled the record of veteran Congress leader Late Parasram Maderna on Tuesday. Pilot will complete six years on January 21.

He assumed the post of PCC president on January 21, 2014 replacing Dr Chandraban after the party suffered its worst ever electoral defeat in the assembly polls in 2013. The party was reduced to just 21 seats in the 200-member house.

It was, however, not a cake walk for the young leader who was elected to the Lok Sabha from Dausa in 2004 at the age of 26, which his father and Late Union minister Rajesh Pilot represented.

The Congress lost all the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. Sachin, who was a minister in the UPA government, lost his Lok Sabha seat of Ajmer in 2014.

The party under his leadership took on the BJP hitting the streets raising public issues. The Congress was able to defeat the ruling party in all the bypolls except Dholpur. The defeat of the ruling party in Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha seats and Mandalgarh assembly seat had set the tone for the assembly elections in December 2018.

He is credited with reviving a moribund party to take on the might of the BJP. The result was for everybody to see with the party bouncing back to power in the state. Sachin, elected to the assembly from Tonk and a claimant to the top job in the state, had to satisfy with the post of deputy chief minister under Ashok Gehlot as the party decided in favour of experience over youth.

The latest challenge for this MBA from the prestigious Wharton School in the US is the upcoming panchayat elections in the state.

195,['8/01/2020'],TDP leaders behind Rs 700cr deposit fraud: Madhusudhana,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Keshava Reddy group of institutions chairman Madhusudhana Reddy on Tuesday alleged that TDP leaders Nara Lokesh and Adinarayana Reddy were involved in the Rs 700-crore deposit fraud case involving the group. He also met Kadapa SP K K N Anburajan and sought police protection claiming there was threat to his life from the family members of Adinarayana.

It may be recalled that the founder chairman of the group, Nagireddy Keshava Reddy, was arrested in connection with the multi-crore fraud case in 2015. Investigations by the CID had revealed that he had collected a whopping Rs 700 crore as deposits from parents of wards studying in 40 odd residential schools in AP and Telangana. He was arrested for defaulting in paying back the deposits to nearly 11,000 depositors and 800 other individuals. Three cases were registered against him at Nandyal and two cases at Panyam in Kurnool district.

Madhusudhana, who took over the group after Keshava Reddy’s arrest and is its present chairman, has now lodged a police complaint against former minister Adinarayana, blaming him of usurping the Rs 700 crore collected as deposits by the Keshava Reddy group.

“It was due to this that the school failed to repay the refundable deposits to depositors. After the founder chairman’s arrest, I was asked to take over as chairman while his son-in-law Bharat Reddy was appointed as secretary of the group. Before I took over, I was assured that all depositors’ money would be refunded. But when I started pressurising them to repay the deposits, they started threatening me. My life is at threat and I fear Adinarayana Reddy’s family members will try to kill me which is why I have lodged a complaint against them and sought police protection,” alleged Madhusudhana.

He further alleged that Nara Lokesh had appointed his own people in the group. “I was pressurised me to appoint Lokesh’s men as members of the society and I had no option but to oblige,” he claimed.

When asked, Lokesh dismissed the allegations as “completely baseless”. “This is yet another attempt by the YSR Congress to defame me. YSRC is still behaving like an opposition party. They should realise that they are in power now and have all the resources at their disposal to probe the allegations. I challenge YSRC to first prove these allegations instead of instigating someone to make false accusations against me,” he told TOI.

MEERUT: Hours after a Delhi court issued death warrants against the four convicts in the brutal rape-cum-murder of a paramedic student, Nirbhaya, and set the date for January 22, third generation hangman from Meerut , Pawan Jallad, said on Tuesday that he was ready to carry out the executions.“As of now, I have not received any official word from Tihar jail administration about carrying out the executions. But, I am ready for it. A few days ago, I was asked by Tihar to remain on standby for the executions in Nirbhaya case. Being a father, I will be satisfied if I get to hang those rapists,” Pawan told media outside his home in Meerut.The execution will be carried out on January 22, at 7am in Tihar jail. The court said the convicts can use their legal remedies within 14 days.UP’s director general (prison administration and reform services), who had in December confirmed Tihar jail administration's correspondence for hangman, said that Tihar administration has not sent any fresh correspondence to UP jail authorities on requisition of hangman.As the preparations of hanging kick-starts, all eyes are on UP which would be sending one of its hangman for the job. UP jail authorities have two hangmen, one in Meerut and the other in Lucknow, on retainership basis. Tihar administration had recently written to UP jail administration requesting to keep hangman on standby and their services would be sought as per requisition.Hired by UP Directorate of Prisons in 2013, Pawan is still itching for his “first kill”. He missed an “opportunity” four years ago when high court commuted Surinder Koli’s death sentence to life imprisonment in the Nithari case. “For seven days, I strenuously prepared for the execution. But he got away,” Pawan had said.Pawan is hopeful this time.Six people were convicted for brutally raping and murdering the 23-year-old student in a moving bus while she was on her way back home on December 16, 2012 in Delhi.

BIJNOR: A 22-year-old labourer was buried alive on Tuesday when soil caved in on him while he was working in a 20-foot-deep old well.

The deceased was identified as Sanjay Kumar of Manakpur village. His body was fished out three hours later. The cave in occurred around 12:30 pm at Sadaruddin Nagar village under Nahtaur police station area.

Sanjay’s family staged a protest at the site, demanding compensation for his death. They were pacified only after police reached the spot and assured them that a case would be filed against Viresh Singh, the farmer who had hired him for excavating the bricks from the well.

According to villagers, the old borewell’s walls were constructed with bricks several years also. At present, the well was dry. The farmer had hired some labourers to excavate the old bricks.

Sanjay was inside the well and taking out the bricks when the soil collapsed on him. The farmer and other labourers tried to dig him out but it took three hours and by that time, he was dead.

His family filed a complaint with police, alleging that Viresh Singh had hired Sanjay for agriculture work but assigned him the task of digging out old bricks from the well.

According to station house officer, Satya Prakash Singh, police are still probing the matter. The deceased’s body has been sent to the district hospital for post-mortem.

leopardess

BIJNOR: A day after a villagers gunned down a leopard in Najibaabd area, forest authorities have stepped up efforts to capture a leopardess that has killed at least three people around Mohandiya village in Mandawar area. At the suggestion of experts of Wildlife Institute of India (WII), forest department will now be applying “cat lure” chemical to trap the elusive leopardess.

Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “We are using ‘cat lure’ -- a pheromones molecule compound of leopards. The smell will attract the big cat to enter a cage. We will then trap it.”

Several techniques have been used to trap the leopard but it has eluded capture. Earlier, forest authorities had set up six cages and over a dozen camera traps at different points of the area. They had kept dogs and goats inside cages as bait. Later, they put chicken and mutton to lure the big cat but it did not work. Now, they hope to apply ‘cat lure’ to attract big cats inside cages.

The development comes a day after villagers killed a leopard hours after it mauled to death a 14-year-old boy at Bhogpur village in Najibabad area.

Several senior forest department officials, including chief conservator of the forest (Bareilly zone) Lalit Verma and Moradabad forest conservator Javed Akhtar, visited the area where villagers had killed a leopard on Tuesday.

Soon after, an FIR was filed against 50 to 60 unnamed people at Najibabad police station under the Wildlife Protection Act. Villagers created a ruckus after learning about the FIR.

Najibabad divisional forest officer Manoj Kumar Shukla said, “We have filed an FIR against 50 to 60 (mob) unidentified people for killing a leopard under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act.”

Big cats are posing a threat to farmers who are busy with harvesting sugarcane. In the past one month, over 100 sightings and attacks were reported across the district. They have been here in Bijnor for many years but recently they have started attacking humans. Expert say lack of prey is forcing the big cats to turn towards human habitats around sugarcane fields.

199,['8/01/2020'],Sachin Pilot takes potshots at his govt over Kota kid deaths,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot addresses students at Rajasthan University in the city on Tuesday.

JAIPUR: Deputy CM Sachin Pilot on Tuesday said those with small hearts hide their failures and shortcomings.

Though he did not name anyone, but his remark was seen as a dig at CM Ashok Gehlot and health minister Raghu Sharma, who have blamed the previous BJP government for lack of infrastructure that led to deaths of 112 kids in 37 days in JK Lon Hospital in Kota. The deputy CM was addressing students at the inauguration of Rajasthan University Students Union Office here on Tuesday.

“Only those with a mighty heart can admit their shortcomings and failures. If your intentions are bad and don’t have courage to own your mistakes, you will make excuses to hide. If those who are holding positions tend to react on the basis of their affiliations, it will make a negative impact on the minds of youths,” said Pilot.

His remark that the government can’t escape responsibility and accountability has be to fixed in connection with the Kota child deaths has caused political storm. The next day, Sharma took a dig at Pilot by demanding accountability on Pilot’s PWD.

Earlier in the day, while reacting to Sharma’s political barb, Pilot said, “I have told that accountability has be fixed (over the deaths of infants in Kota) and I am telling it today also that accountability is must so that such incidents are not repeated in future. If the affairs continue without fixing any accountability, it will hamper the government.”

Taking a step further, Pilot asked for the inquiry on those found guilty of negligence in the Kota fiasco.

Continuing his attack on his government, Pilot reiterated that deaths of infants in Kota was a sensitive issue and the government should have handled it with all seriousness. “I am equally pained to hear the reports of infants dying in the similar manner in other cities,” said Pilot, while reacting to the deaths of infants in Jodhpur, Bikaner and Ajmer.

Taking on the BJP for praising his statement, Pilot said the BJP should focus on their role of an opposition. “I as a president of Rajasthan Congress will continue to raise issues concerning public,” said Pilot while advising the BJP to not sit at home and act as an opposition.

200,['8/01/2020'],Real-time weather updates on screen at tourist spots in state,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Jaipur: The next time you visit a tourist spot in Rajasthan, you will get alerts on the weather conditions, pollution levels, humidity and other factors.

The Jaipur meteorological office is coming up with Automatic Weather System ( AWS ) where the minimum and maximum temperatures and other readings would be taken automatically and would be displayed on large screens. The system is likely to be installed at 5-10 cities of tourist importance in Rajasthan in association with the state’s tourism department.

This is a project by Niti Aayog in which ministry of earth sciences has been given the responsibility to install AWS in various cities across the country including Rajasthan.

In every state, the local weather office would get a memorandum of association (MOU) to start the service.

“Logistically, we would need a free space, security arrangement and electricity connection by the state government and we would provide technical support and take care of the electricity bills,” said a senior officer of IMD, Delhi.

Talking to TOI, Shiv Ganesh, director, Jaipur meteorological office, said, “AWS would be installed at almost 10 cities of tourist importance in Rajasthan in the first phase. And the state government, especially its tourism department, will have to select these cities. We will have to coordinate with the tourism department to select the stations, space and other technical support.”

With the system, the tourists and locals would be able to get an update of the minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity levels, air quality, ultraviolet index and other important information. “Also, the system would enable our local weather office to get online update on the weather information and we won’t have to go for manual reading of the temperature as we do in the weather observatory,” said an officer.

However, the local weather office has not been able to discuss the modalities with the state government. They have written to chief secretary D B Gupta and are trying to get in touch with the tourism officials. For AWS, 10x12 metre open space is required and a 10x10 screen.

201,['8/01/2020'],‘Better primary healthcare can reduce infant death rate’,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Surat: Hospitals of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) registered 79,732 births and 1,540 deaths of infants in 2019. Of those who died, 50 per cent had succumbed to malnutrition , pneumonia , diarrhoea and septicaemia.

Infant deaths happen because of diseases, congenital deformities or birth injuries but birth asphyxia does account for maximum neonatal deaths. Whenever stress causes foetus to forceful gasps, then amniotic fluids containing meconium is breathed in and it gets deposited in the lungs of child. This fluid may block newborn’s airways, sources said.

Dr Pradip Umrigar, medical officer of health (MOH), SMC, said, “Proper hygiene in hospitals and nutritious food can prevent many deaths which occur due to less immunity in infants. There should be no compromise on maintenance of hygiene in hospital ICUs. It is not difficult to prevent deaths of children due to malnutrition, pneumonia, diarrhoea and septicaemia.”

Against national average of 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, Surat’s infant death ratio is 14 deaths per 1,000 live births, the sources added.

Dr Nirmal Choraria, head of department of paediatrics NICU, PICK at Nirmal Hospital on Ring Road, said, “Premature births, birth asphyxia and neonatal pneumonia are top causes for infant deaths in Gujarat. Prematurely born children have low immunity. Maternal malnutrition, delayed diagnosis, absence of tertiary health care and shortage of trained nursing staff are among other reasons for infant deaths. To reduce infant death rate, we need to strengthen our primary healthcare and improve nutritional status of mothers.”

Kozhikode: The BJP ’s campaign to garner support for the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) suffered another jolt with the media department of Jamia Markaz coming out with a statement denying that Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar had held discussions with party leader A N Radhakrishnan on the controversial law.

Reacting to Radhakrishnan’s Facebook post which claimed that he had met Kanthapuram and had a ‘preliminary’ discussion on CAA, the Markaz Media asserted that the Sunni leader had abruptly ended the conversation when the BJP leader raised the issue.

“Kanthapuram Ustad was invited for a ‘nikkah’ in Thrissur. One person tried to talk to him when the guests were having lunch. When enquired, the person introduced himself as Radhakrishnan,” said the statement from Markaz Media.

“When the person mentioned CAA, Ustad made it categorically clear that the law is against the Constitution and it is aimed at keeping Muslims outside. When the person continued the conversation, Ustad sternly told him that CAA is not a simple issue to be discussed over lunch,” the statement added.

“Kanthapuram told the person that people in Kerala cutting across caste and religion are united against the law. The conversation ended there and the propaganda related to the incident is baseless,” said the statement.

Sources told TOI that a photograph was taken during the conversation without Kanthapuram’s knowledge and was used for the BJP’s propaganda. Kanthapuram is angry that the BJP is spreading the claim that the Sunni leader has agreed for a detailed discussion.

Karat Razack, LDF-backed independent MLA from Koduvally, also has expressed his displeasure over the BJP using his photograph for CAA campaigns. Local BJP leaders had met the MLA at his house to hand over the propaganda material to him.

206,['8/01/2020'],Meerut: Pillars to come up on disputed UP-Haryana border areas,"This story is from January 8, 2020

MEERUT: With the Uttar Pradesh-Haryana border being in dispute for years as the land of various UP farmers went to Haryana after Yamuna river changed its course, Meerut divisional commissioner on Tuesday took a meeting of officials of 11 districts of UP and Haryana, and asked them to set up strong pillars on the border.

“Strong pillars bordering UP-Haryana border should be set up. While 132 UP villages have a common border with Haryana, 102 Haryana villages have a common border with UP. No cost has been fixed for these pillars,” said Meerut divisional commissioner Anita C Meshram.

TOI in October 2019 reported that Meshram had asked all the districts to prepare an action plan in this regard by November 25, 2019. The Survey of India officials were also roped in for the purpose.

The issue pertains to a four-decade-long dispute. At that time, the Yamuna, which is the borderline of the two states, had changed its course and the then central government had changed the borderline from river stream to a fixed area in some districts, however, several others remained dependent on the river line, which keeps changing its course.

Due to its changing course, it has often led to disputes between the farmers of 11 districts on both the sides and has resulted in violent clashes.

“Pillars should be set up keeping the border in mind. While the odd number pillars will be set up by Haryana, the even number pillars will be set up by UP. Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Shamli, Saharanpur and Aligarh share their borders with Haryana. These are the main areas where many disputes were reported in the past. Meanwhile, Yamuna Nagar, Karnal, Panipat, Sonepat, Faridabad, and Palwal share border with UP. All the pillars should be set up and it should be seen that they are strong enough,” said Meshram.

MADURAI: An army man attempted suicide by holding a high-tension terminal in a transformer on the premises of the Madurai district collectorate on Tuesday. As he fell down from around 10 feet high, he was rushed to the Government Rajaji Hospital, where he is being treated. Police sources said that burn injuries were noticed only on his hands, chest and stomach. Although he had suffered less than 20% injuries, he remains under critical care as it will take more time to ascertain damages to his internal organs. He was identified as P Muthu, 25, from Melaurappanur village in Madurai district. He is working in the Indian army and posted in Rajasthan. Muthu had appeared before the revenue divisional officer (RDO) on Tuesday, after his wife, who attempted suicide a couple of days back, died in hospital not responding to treatment.

Muthu married Thenisha from Nilakottai in Dindigul district three-and-a-half months ago. There were a dispute in the family over dowry. She had consumed poison on Sunday and was rushed to a private hospital in Batlagundu, where first aid was provided. She was shifted to the GRH in the early hours of Monday where she died. A case was registered with the Nilakottai police under 174-CrPc and an inquiry was carried out. Meanwhile, an RDO inquiry was also in progress. Muthu, who came out of the RDO office, went straight to the transformer and climbed on to it. His relatives and others gathered there tried to pacify him. While the melee lasted for a few minutes, he touched the live terminal. After a loud thud, he fell down. Madurai Red Cross shifted him to the hospital.

Nagpur: While the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is working to keep the city clean, the role of Nagpurians in the task cannot be debated.

Last year, city ranked 58th in Swachh Bharat ranking, and to move up the rankings, the NMC is all set to launch ‘Mummy, Papa You Too’ campaign emphasizing on the role of residents in keeping the city clean, said mayor Sandip Joshi on Monday.

Joshi pointed out that in 2013, corporators and officials from Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) had visited Nagpur city to study NMC’s solid waste management plan. “But today Indore has moved far ahead in cleanliness because its residents are playing an equally important role along with IMC,” he said.

“So, in Nagpur too participation of citizens is required to improve the city’s ranking,” said health committee chairman Virendra Kukreja.

The NMC, in association with state education department and traffic police, will be launching the campaign from January 13 to 19. The NMC will approach 3.10 lakh students of 1,400 schools across the city as part of the campaign.

Joshi said that under the campaign the NMC will ask children to educate their parents on keeping the city clean. “The campaign has a hidden agenda which conveys through children that ‘Mummy Papa we are ashamed of you for throwing garbage on road, spitting, urinating in open places etc’” he said.

Giving details of the plan, Joshi said that on January 8 the NMC will convene a meeting of schools principals at Suresh Bhat auditorium where they will be informed about the campaign.

The NMC will organize various competitions during this period and prizes will be given on February 2. The mayor said the Central government Swachh Survekshan team will arrive anytime this year and sounded confident about improvement in city’s Swachh rankings.

According to him, last year the city bagged 58th position among over 4,000 cities, while this year around 6,500 cities will participate in the survekshan.

Events under NMC’s initiative

January 11 | Parent-teacher meet in all schools of the city at 9am. Ward corporators, social workers and teachers will talk to parents about the campaign. PowerPoint presentations will be given on cleanliness and awareness created on road transport laws.

January 13 | National-level elocution competition on ‘Mummy Papa you too?’. First three winners to get Rs11,000, Rs5,000 and Rs3,000, respectively.

NAGPUR: Local crime branch (LCB) of rural police on Tuesday nabbed four persons for allegedly murdering a relative of Shiv Sena candidate contesting Kanhan Municipal Council elections.

The deceased Sanju Khadse was stabbed in the stomach before being stoned to death outside a bar following a drunken brawl on Monday night at Kanhan. Police sources have ruled out political rivalry behind the murder.

The arrested persons have been identified as Sachin Wadibhasme, Bhupesh Shahu and Nitesh Patle. While the police have detained Swapnil alias Chuha Marathe, he was yet to be formally arrested. Sources informed that intially Nitesh tried to hoodwink the cops by not revealing his name and instead identified himself as Sagar Chaudhari.

According to sources, Daniel Shinde is contesting Kanhan Municipal Council election, scheduled for next week, on Shiv Sena ticket . Khadse, a relative of Shinde, was engaged in the campaigning. On Monday night, Khadse had gone to a bar where the accused were already present. As the accused were creating scenes in the bar, Khadse reportedly asked them to behave. This irked the accused and a quarrel broke out following which Khadse slapped Sachin. Thereafter, the accused left the bar only to return to avenge the insult.

After some time, when Khadse came out of the bar the accused were waiting from him. Sachin stabbed Khadse in the stomach and one of the other accused smashed his head with a stone and fled the scene. Khadse succumbed to the injuries.

On getting information, Kanhan police rushed to the spot along with LCB counterparts. LCB in-charge Anil Jittawar deputed a team to nab the absconding accused and on a tip off raided a slum in Kamptee area. On seeing the approaching cops, Sachin fled the slum. The cops managed to nab Sachin after a chase of nearly four km. The police also arrested two of the accused Bhupesh and Nitesh. On Tuesday evening, the cops nabbed Marathe from city’s red-light area Ganga-Jamuna.

Further investigations are being carried out.

CAUGHT IN THE ACT

MEERUT: The administration of Saharanpur district hospital on Tuesday ordered a probe after a video of a nurse purportedly taking bribe from a patient in the emergency ward went viral on social media.

Officials said a panel of two doctors has been formed to check the veracity of the video, as the management has claimed that the nurse was not on duty at the emergency ward at the time of recording the incident.

“A video has come to the fore, wherein a permanent employee – a staff nurse—at the district hospital, Sita, was caught on camera taking bribe from a patient. The time and date of the video is not clear, and it looks like it was shot in December-end. An inquiry has been set up with two senior doctors on the panel,” said Dr SK Varshney, superintendent-in-chief, Saharanpur district hospital.

Meanwhile, the nurse has been removed from the position until the inquiry is completed.

The video purportedly shows nurse Sita taking money from the patient and telling the latter to come to her for any kind of help.

BS Sodhi, chief medical officer, Saharanpur, said, “The superintendent-in-chief of the district hospital has set up an inquiry. If the nurse is found guilty, then strict action will be taken.”

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Even as the National Commission for Women and various women’s organisations welcomed the death warrants issued against the Nirbhaya convicts , they renewed their call for speedy justice within a stipulated timeframe and warned that death penalty should not be seen a solution to the problem of rape as the focus should be on prevention of violence against women and systemic reforms to ensure that.

Reacting to the court order, NCW chief Rekha Sharma said, “Justice is delayed but not denied this time”. “ I would have liked if the decision could have come much earlier. The hanging of these convicts will send out a strong message and act as a deterrent,” she added.

Echoing similar sentiments, Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal demanded all such cases be decided within six months. “Even though it has taken seven years and is delayed but this order of the court has come as big relief and respite to all the Nirbhayas across the country. Finally justice will be done.”

Ranjana Kumari, director of Centre for Social Research said while the court order is welcome, the fact that it took seven years reflects that fasttrack justice is still to become real. “Also no one should assume that death penalty will lead to end of such crimes. These crimes can be prevented by ensuring the judicial process is fast tracked. In fact, Nirbhaya’s case itself should be studied to understand what took seven years and can be a case study for assessing the reason for the delay,” she added.

To create awareness around the issue of women safety, NCW is now planning to reach out to districts. “We will be holding campaigns across states in collaboration with state commissions during the course of the year,” Sharma said.

National Federation for India Women general secretary, Annie Raja said, “Bringing amendments to the existing laws when a case gets highlighted is not the solution. Reforms are required. We need to focus on witness protection, more forensic laboratories, police and judicial reforms and a review of implementation of existing legislations.”

Enakshi Ganguly from Haq: Centre for Child Rights asked, “If death penalty is the deterrent, it is promised to be, then all rapes must end with four men being hanged. Isn’t that what we are always told — death penalty is essential to instil fear and be a deterrence.” Ganguly said if we really want deterrence then there was need to focus on preventing violence. Ganguly and her team are working closely on cases and counselling of survivors of sexual assault, rape and violence.

MEERUT: With the Uttar Pradesh-Haryana border being in dispute for years as the land of various UP farmers went to Haryana after Yamuna river changed its course, Meerut divisional commissioner on Tuesday took a meeting of officials of 11 districts of UP and Haryana, and asked them to set up strong pillars on the border.

“Strong pillars bordering UP-Haryana border should be set up. While 132 UP villages have a common border with Haryana, 102 Haryana villages have a common border with UP. No cost has been fixed for these pillars,” said Meerut divisional commissioner Anita C Meshram.

TOI in October 2019 reported that Meshram had asked all the districts to prepare an action plan in this regard by November 25, 2019. The Survey of India officials were also roped in for the purpose.

The issue pertains to a four-decade-long dispute. At that time, the Yamuna, which is the borderline of the two states, had changed its course and the then central government had changed the borderline from river stream to a fixed area in some districts, however, several others remained dependent on the river line, which keeps changing its course.

Due to its changing course, it has often led to disputes between the farmers of 11 districts on both the sides and has resulted in violent clashes.

“Pillars should be set up keeping the border in mind. While the odd number pillars will be set up by Haryana, the even number pillars will be set up by UP. Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Shamli, Saharanpur and Aligarh share their borders with Haryana. These are the main areas where many disputes were reported in the past.

Man-animal conflict

Mangaluru: Villagers of Singanur , Nandikadu Parla-Makki in Belthangady taluk bordering Chikkamagaluru district are an angry lot. A herd of elephants has been troubling them for the past one week and the forest department has done little to tackle the problem, claim villagers.

On Monday night, a tusker and a herd went berserk and damaged banana, areca and paddy fields within a 15-km radius. More than 300-400 areca and banana plants were destroyed and in some places paddy fields too were completely damaged. The estimated loss is expected to run in to several lakhs of rupees, say villagers.

Using crackers and fire to chase away the elephants did not work but only increased the damage, a villager rued. “The jumbo menace has spread to over a 15-km radius in Didupe limits. If government sets up a camp every 5km, it would save crops worth lakhs. We have been living with this problem for the last two years and nothing has been done,” said angry villagers.

As many as 50 arecanut trees belonging to Vasanthi were uprooted, Ramanna’s naga bana damaged and Sanjeeva’s banana plantation become fodder for the elephants. Apart from it, in Addatodi a water pipeline too was damaged. Villagers say a lone tusker has been spotted wandering during day time on the Charmadi Ghat stretch.

Manjunath, range forest office, Belthangady, said that they have not received any complaints from villagers. “We will take action if villagers request us,” he said.

According to forest officials, in 2018-19, 16 applications were received and 15 persons were compensated with Rs 1.90 lakh for crop damages. In 2019-20, so far 11 applications were received and 5 people were given Rs 77,000 in total.

MEERUT: A bunch of thieves, who came in a truck, broke into a LPG cylinder godown in Hapur’s Hafizganj area and decamped with 68 cylinders on Monday night. An FIR under sections 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 380 (theft in dwelling house) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Hafizganj police station.

The security guard present at the spot was overpowered by the thieves, who took at least two hours to load 68 cylinders in the truck.

They had also kept another set of 54 LPG cylinders at the main exit to transport it to a discreet location later, but the guard managed to alert the owner and local police by then.

“The guard woke up due to commotion, but he was in his bed and didn’t raise any alarm after seeing himself outnumbered. He alerted the godown owner and local police later. But, by the time help arrived, assailants had decamped with 68 cylinders. They were planning to ferry another set of 54 cylinders in the next trip,” said Sarvesh Mishra, additional superintendent of police in Hapur said.

The guard later narrated the sequence of events.

“At least 10 to 12 men barged into the premises at around 2am. They broke the locks of the godown to get inside. One of the assailants held me at gun point near the watch tower,” said Sattu Singh, the guard.

Rajkot: Vehicle dealers in Rajkot continued to reel under poor sales that have witnessing a downward spiral since 2017.

The sales of cars and two-wheelers declined steadily in Rajkot in 2019 too, according to the vehicle registration figures of the union road transport ministry.

While two-wheeler sales declined by nearly 20.5% compared to 2018, while car sales were down 14.3% in the same period.

Dealers, however, said they saw a better uptake of vehicles in the months of October and December. “The sales were good in October and December because the manufactures announced attractive schemes for buyers. We hope that the sales will recover in 2020, but it depends on the union budget,” Harish Chandra, CEO of a dealership.

Shyam Raichura, a car dealership owner, added, “There was an overall recession in 2019 that affected all the sectors and resulted in a drastic fall in vehicle sales. We are hopeful of some correction in 2020 as the sales increased in December across all the brands.”

In Ahmedabad, registration of vehicles registered a drop for the second consecutive year in 2019. The city recorded a drop of 16% compared to 2018 figure. While the two-wheeler segment registered a decline of 18.44% in 2019, sales of car dipped by 13.44%.

Compared to 2017, car sales registered a sharp decline of 20% in 2019 in the city. Against 2.13 lakh vehicle registrations in 2017, the city registered only 1.71 lakh vehicles in 2019.

According to a senior RTO official, one of the reasons for the decline in car sales is economic slowdown. “People have been finding it tough to manage their home budgets. I think, parking issues and traffic drives too have contributed to the decline,” he said. The RTO official said that the steep hike in traffic fines also affected the sales figures. “People have been going for car pool or taking radio cabs to escape hefty fines,” he added.

Kozhikode: The location of the proposed model village to rehabilitate Puthumala landslide victims in Wayanad has been shifted from the earlier identified site at Kalladi to a new area near Meppadi .

Wayanad district authorities said the change in location has been necessitated as it was found that the eight acres at Vazhakkala estate at Kalladi, which was initially identified for the project, was caught up in a civil case over ownership dispute.

Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdulla said the media house which had promised to provide seven acres for the model village will now hand over alternative land held by them at Puttakkoli Estate near Meppadi to the state government on January 16.

“While we are planning to set up the model village at the new location, parallelly we are also moving ahead with providing Rs 10 lakh to those victims who have identified land on their own for setting up houses elsewhere,” Adeela said, adding that 10 victims have so far submitted applications for obtaining the Rs 10 lakh relief and processing of their applications are underway.

She said the district administration has received commitment from various sponsors to build around 60 houses in the model village.

It was earlier announced that the model village is to be constructed at a cost of Rs 12 crore, which has 56 houses in the first phase. The houses are to be constructed in an eco-friendly manner and the village will have a playground, anganwadi, health centre, rainwater harvesting and drinking water supply systems.

The deadly landslide on August 8, 2019 had totally wiped away the plantation village of Puthumala. However, the residents of the village had expressed their wish to the authorities to live together as a community rather than being rehabilitated individually following which the authorities drew up the project for a model village.

Meanwhile the district legal services authority (DLSA) on Monday distributed household items provided by the judges of the Supreme Court to the landslide hit families of Puthumala . Household items including furniture were distributed to 40 families at the function held at Meppadi public library. DLSA chairman and district sessions judge A Harris inaugurated the programme.

MADURAI: Nearly 40 years after it started receiving water through its traditional supply channels from Vaigai river, the Mariamman Teppakulam appears to be fast turning into a dump yard of plastic waste and dead rodents.

A city known to be bereft of recreational spots, the water-filled tank has been a major attraction of late with people thronging it in the evenings. Many roadside eateries have sprung up around it, but this has resulted in the pollution of the tank. On Tuesday, morning walkers were hit by the stench of animal carcass. A peep into the tank showed many dead mice floating amidst empty milk packets, cups, paper plates and other waste .

“The smell was unbearable and it was a sorry sight as the water which was clean when it flowed into the tank had become very dirty,” said S Mahendran, a morning walker. He expects the pungent smell to turn worse since the filling of the tank is over and the water has been stagnant. As the afternoon temperatures rise it will start drying up.

Co-ordinator of Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam M Rajan, one of the people responsible for filing a petition to bring water into the tank through its traditional channels, said the eateries that had mushroomed around Teppakulam were contributing to the waste being dumped there. ``So much effort was taken to bring water to the tank, now it should also be maintained well. Youngsters are bathing in it and people continue to throw waste into it. On Tuesday it seems like somebody found it convenient to dump mice they had trapped in large numbers into the tank,’’ he said adding that the HR and CE department which was in charge of the tank should take steps to maintain it well. Proper lighting and regularisation of the eateries was a must to ensure that the waste generated was disposed properly. Industries in Madurai would be ever willing to help deploy watchmen to ensure cleanliness near the tank, he said.

Joint Commissioner of Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple N Natarajan said that steps were being taken to clean the tank regularly using a boat. ``Steps are also being taken to prevent people from polluting it,’’ he said.

According to him, the dead rats were not dumped in the tank but were the ones that inhabited it when it was dry. “Now when the water filled it, the rats drowned and are floating,” he told TOI. The rats in the central mandapam which has building and plants are also falling into the water in search of food, he added.

Jodhpur: Jodhpur police seized 700 litre of ghee and 120 litre of edible oil, busting a manufacturing unit at village Tabadia Kalan in Bhopalgarh subdivision on Tuesday evening and arrested one person in the matter. This spurious ghee and oil had been manufactured to be used during the upcoming panchayat elections in the district in the mass banquets for villagers.

SP (Jodhpur Rural) Rahul Barhat said that total 47 tins of ghee and eight tins of oil have been seized from the unit, which belonged to one Gopal Singh Rajput.

226,['8/01/2020'],"Nagpur: Whatever your age, get your name added in birth certificate before May","This story is from January 8, 2020

NAGPUR: In a major respite for citizens rushing to get their documents updated before the National Population Register ( NPR ) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Nagpur Municipal Corporation ’s (NMC) birth and death registration department has clarified that those wanting to add their names in birth certificates can do so by May 14, 2020, which is the final cut off date. There is no age criteria for the process.

After the deadline, no extension to the age limit waiver would be allowed as per Maharashtra government’s resolution dated July 27, 2015.

Medical officer and sub registrar Ateequr Raheman Khan told TOI that earlier, the addition of names used to be done at the zone office level for kids up to the age of 5 years. “Later, the age was extended up to 15 years by the Central government for those born after January 2020. Now, the age limit has been removed. People must utilize this opportunity to add their names in birth certificates,” Khan said.

As names are finalized later, many used to get birth certificates without the name, but with the names of their parents, date and place of birth and gender. Often, people didn’t bother to add names in the birth certificates.

With NPR and NRC linked to the sensitive issue of proving one’s citizenship, people, primarily Muslims, are a worried lot as their birth certificates do not carry their names.

Khan said names of parents and date of birth in supporting documents must match with the NMC records as well as those on the birth certificate without the name.

In case the details mismatch, citizens will have to go through a long drawn process of getting fresh birth certificates. As per Section 13 (3) of Registration of Births and Deaths 1969, applicants will have to prepare a non-availability (NA) proposal to be put before JMFC. The proposal too requires government IDs such as leaving certificate, SSC marklist, Voter ID, Aadhaar, etc. The process requires several rounds to the NMC office followed by the court which issues the order. It takes around two months to get a birth certificate with the fees between Rs3000 to Rs4000.

Muslims outnumber others

Members from the Muslim community have outnumbered the others in queries related to birth and death records in the wake of the NPR and NRC implementation across the country. On Tuesday, the NMC birth and death registration department started keeping a count after it was flooded with people coming with such queries since the last one month. On the first day, 225 queries were recorded with only 45 from non-Muslims. The rest of the queries were from Muslims who mainly wanted details of birth and death certificates of their grandparents, parents, children and themselves. By the first week of January, the NMC received 28 applications for major corrections in certificates as they need to match with other ID proofs. In December, 72 such applications were received for the same purpose while the number count in November was 76.

227,['8/01/2020'],Madurai: Disabled man petitions collector alleging bias in MBBS admission,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Arunkumar

MADURAI: After more than two years of ongoing court battle over being denied an opportunity to write the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) exam, a differently-abled man has now petitioned the district collector Dr T G Vinay seeking his help.

Arunkumar G, 27, from Villapuram wrote the NEET exam in 2018 and secured above the cut-off mark for the differently-abled persons quota. However, he was not given a chance in counselling that year despite being declared fit and issued a certificate of disability by the regional medical board in Chennai. Arunkumar had lost three of his fingers, including his thumb, after being injured during an accident in 2008. After his complaint to the director of medical education (DME) did not receive any reply, the 27-year-old took the matter to court. “As it was argued that my fitness certificate was only valid for 2018, the court ordered me to appear before a panel of doctors from the regional medical board, Chennai again in 2019. They declared me fit. However, I was not called for counselling that year also. I felt betrayed and filed for contempt of court,” said Arunkumar.

During the hearing of the case, the defendant’s advocates argued that since the differently-abled man had written the NEET exam only in 2018, he cannot be called for counselling in 2019 just on the basis of the fitness certificate.

On Monday, he petitioned the district collector alleging wrongful discrimination against differently-abled persons on the basis of physical appearance when it comes to providing jobs and education of their choice and driving licence, which is basic for commuting. “It is very common for such discrimination to happen. Despite availability of quotas, rarely do people from our community get a job that is equal to their educational qualification and paid on a par with those without disability,” said S Raja, district secretary, differently-abled welfare association.

Arunkumar has a diploma in medical laboratory technology from Madurai Medical College. “I’m able to handle equipment and I cleared both theory and practical exams during my course. However, wherever I go, I’m being denied jobs just because of my missing fingers.”

228,['8/01/2020'],"Kerala: Engineering entrance exam to turn simpler, NCERT syllabus to be included","This story is from January 8, 2020

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala entrance examination for admission to engineering and allied courses in the state is likely to become a bit simpler from the current year onwards as the state government has decided to assimilate the changes in the National Council of Educational Research and Training ( NCERT ) syllabus over the years while preparing question papers.

Instructions were given to question paper setters, mostly from outside the state, to keep the questions analogous to the existing syllabus that NCERT follows for Class XI and XII. Though it was over a decade ago when NCERT made any comprehensive change in syllabus and curriculum, changes were taking place in dribs and drabs over the last few years. “Some of the chapters in physics and chemistry were removed altogether in the recent years. There were also additions too that keep the syllabus more timely and connects students with latest developments in science and technology,” said a P Sathyanesan, academic consultant, Kerala State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT).

Several academic experts had pointed out that entrance question papers need to timely assimilate the changes that took place in the syllabus in the last few years. “This, however, would not lead to any structural changes in the examination. The number of questions, its pattern and everything else would remain the same. Only thing is that questions would keep a close connection with the syllabus that students followed in their higher secondary course. This could make the test becoming simpler a bit,” sources close to the developments said.

Meanwhile, there could be less number of entrance examination centres this year. “As per the trend over the past few years, there is an average 10% decrease in the number of candidates appearing for engineering entrance. The number of participants was below one lakh in 2019. There were 325 examination centres within the state and three centres outside, in Mumbai, New Delhi and Dubai.

The association of self-financing engineering colleges had been demanding the government to introduce mechanism for assessing the engineering aptitude of students seeking admission to the course. “We feel that the practice of choosing students based on their academic skills alone should come to an end. But, there seems no move in that direction,” said self-financing engineering college managements’ association secretary K G Madhu.

The state engineering entrance examination is scheduled to be held on April 20 and 21.

In a letter dated January 6, Singh wrote that after three decades, Congress got its zila pramukh in Kota, Surendra Gurjar, and the partymen had struggled hard to enthrone him on this post but charges of corruption levelled against him by ACB are painful for the party. Singh claimed that in a meeting held on January 2 in Simliya gram panchayat, the party workers consented to remove Gurjar from zila pramukh’s post and dismiss him from the party. He added that for the first time in the state’s history party workers of state assembly area have demanded removal and dismissal of their own party member.

Stressing that conveying message to the public was necessary in the political system, the MLA reminded CM Gehlot about his budget speech on July 10, 2019, that his government would work on the policy of ‘zero discretion, zero corruption and zero harassment’. He referred to the standards of best behavior in public life as mentioned in CM’s budget speech and also to the ‘Seven Sins’ propagated by Mahatma Gandhi.

“Where there are talks for commitment to zero corruption, 100% corruption is underway in mining department of the government,” the MLA stated in his letter.

Grab from the video shared by the businessman

Surat: A 31-year-old businessman from Varachha submitted an application to city police commissionerate on Tuesday alleging that traffic police and tow crane staff were collecting money for towed vehicles, but not issuing receipts to traffic violators. The businessman has levelled serious corruption allegations against the cops and shared videos on social media too. The complainant has also submitted an application to anti-corruption bureau (ACB).

Milan Desai, owner of a mobile service franchise, in his application demanding action against the cops alleged that his friend Dharmesh Khunt’s motorcycle was towed away by traffic police crane on Monday evening. He accompanied Khunt to get the motorcycle released.

Desai inquired about the seized motorcycle from a cop at Gitanjali on Varachha Road. “The policeman asked me to talk to a staffer on the crane. I went to him when the man told me to give Rs400, Rs100 less than regular charge, to get the motorcycle released,” Desai told TOI.

After Desai paid Rs400, they were given the motorcycle but the traffic cops did not give any receipt. “They told us you will have to pay Rs500 if you want receipt. If anyone agrees to pay Rs500 for a receipt, the cops start demanding driving licence, PUC, insurance and registration papers,” he added.

Desai shot the entire incident with three different phones’ cameras. He contacted other victims on the spot from whom the cops had collected Rs400 but did not give them the receipts.

“To avoid harassment and to save Rs100, a number of people were paying Rs400. It is a racket and I have written about it to police and anti-corruption bureau, Desai added.

“I have received the application and we will conduct an inquiry. I am yet to get the videos,” said Prashant Sumbe, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.

Sumbe claimed that when a towed vehicle is brought to the storage area, it gets registered and an entry is made when it is returned to the owner. But there exists no regular checking system to match the seizures and the fine collected against each vehicle, he said.

The opening of the Jai Prakash Nagar station on the Sitabuldi-Khapri stretch (Reach I) has proved to be a boon... Read More

NAGPUR: The opening of the Jai Prakash Nagar station on the Sitabuldi-Khapri stretch (Reach I) has proved to be a boon for Nagpur Metro as the ridership has almost doubled. The station was opened on November 20, 2019. Another reason is the increase in the frequency of trains from November 27. Earlier, it was every 30 minutes. Now, it is at 15-minute intervals.

Figures compiled by MahaMetro show that the average daily ridership in November 2019 was about 1,812 and the daily collection was Rs34,966. The corresponding figures for December are 3,613 and Rs65,085. The monthly ridership of November was 54,356 and collection was Rs10.49 lakh. The figures increased to 1,11,990 and Rs20.18 lakh in December.

A MahaMetro official said that the increase in ridership was due to the opening of the Jai Prakash Nagar station. “A lot of people board the Metro from there and many get down as well. You can always see commuters at this station. The increase in frequency has also increased ridership,” he added.

The official further said that the Rahate Colony station would be opened soon followed by Chhatrapati Nagar. “We are expecting ridership to increase significantly after opening of these stations,” he added.

MahaMetro had planned to open all the stations in Reach I by the end of December 2019. However, it has missed this target. Only one station started after the initial five. The remaining stations are expected to open by March end. Various reasons have delayed the opening.

The official feels that ridership of Reach I will also increase after Reach III (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch) becomes operational. “People from Lokmanya Nagar or Subhash Nagar going to say Jai Prakash Nagar or the Airport can change trains at Sitabuldi. Similarly, if a person living in Jai Prakash Nagar wants to go to the Institution of Engineers, he can take the Metro,” he said.

Despite tall promises by Metro officials, feeder services are not available at the stations. This is a big discouragement for people desirous of using the Metro. Unless shared taxis and autorickshaws are made available there, only people living near the stations will use the Metro. City buses have provided connectivity to the stations, but their frequency is not sufficient. These things will have to be sorted out by Metro officials if they really want Nagpurians to use the Metro.

MADURAI: A two-year-old boy, suffering from a rare auto-immune disease affecting his nervous system, has recovered after surviving months on ventilator support at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai .

The boy, Vigneshwaran R, from Anna Nagar in Madurai, was admitted to the GRH’s pediatric ward on May 24 last year after the boy went into a sudden full-body paralysis. He was diagnosed with the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), an auto-immune disorder which results in rapid-onset of muscle weakness caused damage of the peripheral nervous system by the immune system.

Initially, doctors from the pediatrics dept treated Vigneshwaran with Immunoglobulin and Methyl Prednisolone after which the boy suffered breathing difficulties. For seven months, he was put on ventilator. “The boy was prone to infection and complications being on mechanical ventilation, but our pediatric team successfully ensured his gradual recovery. It is not an easy feat to keep a 2-year-old child on ventilator support for seven months,” said GRH Dean Dr Sangumani J. Treatment through administration of antibiotics, chest physiotherapy and nutritional support were also provided. After eight months of treatment Vigneshwaran has fully recovered and is able to walk with support and consume food. He is set to be discharged on Wednesday. The treatmentwhich could have otherwise cost up to Rs 1.5 crore in a private hospital was done free of cost for the child, under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme.

GANDHINAGAR: Just over a month after the Gujarat government made the wearing of helmets optional in cities and towns, it could be forced to eat humble pie and reverse its decision. Following a rap from the Supreme Court-monitored road safety committee and the central government issuing an advisory to states that they cannot lower penalties below the level prescribed in the new Motor Vehicles Act, it seems the state government will soon withdraw its relaxation of the mandatory helmets rule.Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Tuesday said, “People have to use two-wheelers frequently. Women have to use two wheelers to drop and pick up their children to school and tuition classes. This was a problem and we had taken the decision (to make helmets optional) after getting feedback from the people. We will now act according to directions of the Supreme Court or central government.”In a cabinet decision on December 4, 2019, the government passed a resolution stating that wearing helmets will not be compulsory in areas under municipal corporations and municipalities. The decision was taken after the government received several representations from the people against making the use of helmets compulsory.The state government could find itself in more trouble over notifying penalties for various traffic offences.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73152086,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dust-your-helmets-they-could-be-compulsory-again/articleshow/73146896.cms

Farmers spray pesticides at a field in Jaisalmer on Tuesday.

JAISALMER: The locust menace has created havoc in the entire Jodhpur division . The insects are destroying crops in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore, Sirohi and Pali. The efforts to control locusts are proving insufficient. So, farmers along with government authorities are trying to control the problem

Meanwhile, BSF has sounded high alert over likely invasion of swarm of locusts from Pakistan on Monday. On Tuesday, BSF DIG Mukesh Singh held a meeting with all commandants, ADM O P Vishnoi, locust control and agriculture department officers. In the meeting, it was decided to share information and increase coordination.

BSF sources said it has directed company commanders and jawans to keep watch on locusts entering into India from Pakistan and inform immediately to BSF headquarters and district administration.

In Western Rajasthan, the situation has gone totally out of control and locusts have destroyed crops and farmers now themselves have started destroying locusts.

Locusts have spread over 1,000km area in last few days. Swarms of locusts have attacked Ramgarh and Mohangarh canal areas and 5,000 farmers have spread in the area with their tractors. These farmers, along with department teams, are spraying pesticides. The farmers are also burning material to control the insects. Women and children beat plates to drive those insects from their fields.

On Monday night, locusts attacked in Bhi, Bhopa, and other villages. Farmers, locust and agriculture department officials, including joint directors Jagpal Singh, Dr. J P Singh, locust control officer Om Prakash Chaudhary, agriculture department deputy director Radheyshayam Narewal, joint director Om Prakash and teams have started destroying locusts.

A company has launched two drones to spray pesticides. A drone in one minute sprays pesticides in three bighas of land.

According to sources, locusts have laid eggs in Pakistan and the young ones will once again create problems for India. Pakistan has requested China and Saudi Arabia to help in killing locusts. Locusts have affected 6,364 villages in10 districts of Rajasthan.

NEW DELHI: All the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case , who were handed the death sentence on Tuesday, will now be shifted to a solitary cell in jail number 3 . During the 14-day period, they will be allowed to meet their family members, prepare a will and listen to readings of religious scriptures . All four of them will be counselled on a daily basis by the jail counsellor.Special care would be taken to ensure that their health does not deteriorate. They would be kept on a simple diet and allowed to keep one set of clothes and only necessary personal belongings. Sources say that the convicts can still opt for a mercy or curative petition during this period, subject to the pleas being granted by the court, even though the one-week period allotted for them to file for a mercy plea has lapsed.Under the new jail rules implemented in 2018, the family members of the convicts would be handed the death sentence in a red envelope. The acknowledgement, along with the date of receipt, should be entered in a register. The death sentence would also be read out to the convicts.“During the period of 14 days, the convicts hand over their personal belongings to the family members. Death row convicts are shifted to a brightly lit, solitary confinement cell where they are kept under the watch of a warden through the day,” said a jail source.After being shifted to the confinement cells, the four convicts can be allowed to meet each other, but only in presence of a jail staffer. The jail authorities would also take their measurements for the clothes that they will be made to wear while being hanged.The source added that convicts under a death row run into bouts of anxiety and depression after their mercy plea is rejected. “In case of hanging of Ujagar Singh and Kartar Singh alias Ranga Billa, one of them had run into a state of depression to the extent that he had started developing bouts of illness.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73149897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1202072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/time-to-prepare-will-make-peace-with-god/articleshow/73146890.cms

TRICHY: Trichy City Corporation has embarked on a study to widen the approach roads of the Road over Bridge (RoB) on Salai Road by utilising the infrastructure and amenities fund of the state government. The civic body jointly with the Southern Railway has also planned to replace the centuries-old British-era road over bridge near Trichy Fort railway station.

Salai Road RoB often called Maris Theatre RoB serves as a crucial link between the commercial streets namely Main Guard Gate, Karur Bypass Road and Thillai Nagar. The RoB across the railway tracks between Trichy Fort and Mutharasanallur railway stations was built with brick and lime mortar in 1866. While the approach roads of the RoB are maintained by Trichy City Corporation, the span of the bridge over the tracks are managed by the Southern Railway. Though the RoB was strengthened in 2011 with epoxy grout, both the Railways and the civic body arrived at a decision to replace the RoB because of its age. The proposal was only in talks since 2017, and the corporation came forward to widen the approach roads under Smart Cities Mission in 2019. But now, changing the plan, the civic body has opted to avail the infrastructure and amenities fund of the state government. Subsequently, a study by a consultant is initiated.

While the approach roads will be redeveloped by the civic body, the RoB over the railway tracks will be jointly developed by Southern Railway and Trichy City Corporation. “We have written to the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration (CMA) seeking fund. Railways have sought for 50-50 share in bearing the cost of building a new span of the RoB,” a senior official with the corporation said. The Southern Railway has estimated the cost of the new RoB at Rs 20 crore. The study will also estimate the cost to widen the approach roads and the feasibility to widen the road to a maximum possible extent.

The corporation said that the existing RoB will be demolished for constructing the new RoB once the proposal is materialised. “The proposal should be expedited swiftly. Width of the RoB’s span over the track should be at least 10 metres, for the smooth flow of traffic,” Subash Chandran, a resident of Woraiyur, said. The civic body added that no land is acquired for widening the approach roads.

242,['8/01/2020'],More than 13% long-time mobile users face hearing loss: Survey,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nagpur: A recent study conducted in Nagpur to evaluate hearing status in chronic mobile phone users reveals that about 13% of them could face hearing loss if they continue long duration calls on cellphones.

Students and professors of ENT department at city’s NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (Lata Mangeshkar Hospital) conducted the survey and published it recently in the panacea journal of medical sciences.

“The study was like an in-house exercise of our college in which 60 MBBS students were selected as subjects. They were using mobile phones for at least a year and did not have any other causes of or family history of hearing loss,” said Dr Nitin Deosthale, professor of ENT department.

“In the study group, dominant ear of the subjects was included and non-dominant ear was considered as a control group. We conducted pure-tone audiometry to evaluate their hearing status,” he said.

Pure-tone audiometry is described as the gold standard test for assessment of a hearing loss.

Of the total students, 76.66% were using their right ear as dominant ear during calls while 23.33% were using their left ones. After the audiometry test, it was found that dominant ears of 86.66% had normal hearing and 13.33% had hearing loss in high frequencies (4,000 and 8,000 Hz). Interestingly, hearing was normal in non-dominant ear of all subjects. Mean hearing threshold (burden) in dominant ear was 10.54 + 5.75 dB while in non-dominant ear, it was 6.67 + 3.76 dB.

“More serious issue was the type of hearing loss identified in these 13% subjects. They were identified with sensorineural hearing loss which is generally called ‘permanent’ because there is no pill, medication, or surgery that can restore natural hearing. It can be treated only with the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants,” said Dr Deosthale.

Several other studies conducted on the similar subject by other medical colleges in India also show similar conclusions. Many ENT specialists don’t even recommend over use of head phones, earphones and Bluetooth speakers fixed in ear.

“Headphone-induced hearing damage cannot be ruled out if the use is more. To avoid it, we must break some habits. Firstly, reduce the listening time. Then turn down the volume of headphones. Using good quality head phones is also important,” said Dr Devendra Mahore.

He said that ENT surgeons will discuss these issues during the 72nd Annual Conference of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India (AOICON 2020) that is scheduled to be held in the city between January 9 and 12. More than 480 scientific research papers will be presented during the four-day conference.

243,['8/01/2020'],"Info officer can’t pass order on behalf of FAA, says CIC","This story is from January 8, 2020

Kota: The Central Information Commission (CIC) in a video conference hearing of an appeal by Kota-based activist made a benchmark direction observing that Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) cannot pass an order on behalf of the First Appellate Authority (FAA) and FAA should be senior in rank to CPIO.

The commission also expressed its displeasure at the conduct of the public authority for handling the RTI applications in such a negligent and inappropriate manner.

Activist Sujeet Swami in 2018 filed four applications under RTI Act to CPIO, office of the registrar, Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi and sought information on various points. Finance officer and CPIO, IIT, Mandi, J R Sharma on one of the four RTI applications, made reply on July 2018 but the appellant Swami was not satisfied with the reply, particularly on point number five.

On being dissatisfied with the response, Swami then moved to file online first appeal to the FAA but the CPIO at IIT Mandi, putting the RTI Act’s provisions far aside, made reply on behalf of the FAA and the reply to all the points were the same. The CPIO charged Rs 54 for photocopy of 27 pages but Swami was provided with only eight pages of the reply, instead of 27.

Further disappointed by the same reply by the same officer, Swami on August 11, 2018 moved to file second appeal in the matter on which the hearing through video conferencing was held last week. CIC Vanaja N Sarna from New Delhi heard the matter through video conferencing and sought explanation from CPIO Sharma.

On a query by the commission to explain as to why the first appeal was disposed of by the CPIO on behalf of the FAA, the CPIO was unable to explain anything in this regard.

Referring to Section 19(1) of the RTI Act, the commission stated in its order that it is clear that the FAA should be senior in rank to the CPIO and nowhere it is mentioned or can be interpreted that the CPIO can pass an order on behalf of the FAA. At the FAA stage, the CPIO’s reply is under challenge and the duty of the FAA is to address the issues raised by the appellant in his first appeal while passing a speaking order and as a general principle, a man cannot be a judge in his own cause. It cannot be expected that a CPIO who gave a reply will find fault in his own reply. This shows clear violations of the provisions of the RTI Act in the respondent organization, the commission said.

CM Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State cabinet on Tuesday decided to spend Rs 961.24 crore from Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund for renovating and repairing roads under civic bodies (LSGI) which got damaged in the floods.

The works will be carried out under a project christened ‘chief minister’s scheme for local road renovation’. The government has identified 11,880km of roads in rural as well as urban areas in need of immediate repair and renovation following the deluge that hit Kerala in 2018. Committees would be set up at local level for implementing the project on an urgent basis. District-level technical committees would also be formed to oversee the works. Engineers from local bodies would be members in the committees, a statement from the office of CM’s office said. Wayanad and Kannur districts would get the highest allocation from the scheme. While Wayanad would get Rs 149.44 crore, Kannur would get Rs 120.69 crore. Kasaragod (Rs 15.56 crore), Kottayam (Rs 33.99 crore) and Idukki (Rs 35.79 crore) would be getting the least amount of allocation from the scheme.

Industrial force to be expanded

The cabinet has also decided to expand the strength of state industrial security force (SISF). A total of 2,000 posts would be created in two phases with 1,000 in the first stage. The post creation would be as per the conditions proposed by finance department. The statement, however, did not elaborate the conditions put forward by the finance department. A committee would be formed with additional chief secretary (home) as the chairman and it will submit a report on recruitment, training and deployment of the force. State police chief and Kerala police academy director would be members in the committee.

The force was set up in 2011 for providing security to major state government offices and other government and private establishments. The force, modelled on Central Industrial Security Force, now has a strength of 979 personnel.

In order to smoothen the functioning of Kerala Karunya health insurance scheme, the government would set up a state health agency. As many as 33 posts would be created for this.

The cabinet has decided to close down the centre for science and technology entrepreneurship development society (C-STED) under science and technology department.

Anoop Nambiar has been appointed as managing director of Kerala State Handloom Development Corporation (Hanveev). Pullanikkatt Suresh is the managing director of Steel and Industrial Forgings Limited. Former agriculture director A R Ajayakumar would be new food safety commissioner.

AHMEDABAD: Public sector banks across Gujarat are on a strike on Wednesday as part of a nationwide stir. Some 40,000 members of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA) are participating in the strike. Bankers are protesting because their salaries have not been revised.

“We have demanded that wilful default be declared a criminal offence. At the same time, the government should initiate efforts to make recruitments in the banking sector,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA.

Trade and industry bodies have raised concerns over the closure of public sector banks across the state. They say the move will halt crucial business.

All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) and Western Railways Employees Union (WREU) had announced on Tuesday that they would support the strike by holding protests at various places.

“The Union government is speeding up the process of privatization and now is eyeing the railways,” said RC Sharma, assistant general secretary AIRF and WREU president. “The government is not able to control the economy so it has decided to sell the railways.”

Sharma said that the government has been trying to sell land parcels of railways lying in prime locations to some industrialist.

MANGALURU: The Brahmakalashotsava at the Kateel Temple being held from January 22 to February 3 will be plastic-free . The temple management has decided for zero-plastic use during the upcoming celebrations, and have decided to continue the same in the future.

According to the temple management committee, the Brahmakalashotsava is expected to draw around 25 lakh devotees from across the country, and they have already made arrangements to serve food and prasadam without the use of plastic. Hari Narayana Asranna , temple priest, Kateel Shri Durgaparameshwari Temple , told TOI that earlier the temple served everything on plastic, including the prasadam. However, soon the temple will go plastic-free.

He said starting from this Brahmakalashotsava, the temple has decided to go plastic-free wherever possible. The prasadam will be served in paper covers, and cloth or paper bags will be given to devotees. The temple already procured materials for the same.

Plastic is used in serving food and beverages. Coffee and tea will now be served in paper cups. “Food will be served on plantain leaves, and steel and areca sheaths will be used. The temple is also mulling to use plates made out of fibre for serving food, but it’s not yet finalised,” said Hari Narayana.

The use of plastic will also be cut down in outdoor publicity materials such as banners and buntings. Hari Narayana said that all the banners and buntings will be made from cloth. The management has also strictly banned the use of packaged drinking water bottles inside the temple premises. “In order to provide drinking water to devotees, we have installed a reverse osmosis plant. The water from this plant was put in 20 litre cans and placed around the temple premises, for drinking purposes,” he said. However, holy water or teertha will be continued to be served in plastic bottles. Hari Narayana Asranna said that they increased the grade of plastic of teertha bottles and are exploring alternatives to replace them with non-plastic bottles.

The passion of gardening came to me when I was battling severe diabetes. It helped me engage my mind and body in creative pursuits. Today, I take pride in designing my entire garden by making the best from waste . In fact, involving myself in these activities has helped me to almost get rid of my illness, and because of it I’m healthier than ever.

There is a hut in the garden made of waste carton, a black hill which is basically a slag of ferromanganese and a small well made from a paint drum. I have also created vertical gardens from scrap cupboards, bamboo sticks, used bottles and broken pipes. Bamboo roots are effectively used for decorative purposes. I have nice, healthy papayas in the terrace garden, mainly through the use of kitchen waste.

There is also a small castle waterfall made from broken wall hangings fixed in a paint drum. Other drums are used for making organic fertilizer, and many succulent plants are placed in cooler tanks.

I have a tin container where I put all the natural waste, such as fruits and vegetable waste, dry leaves, petals, grass etc and alternatively layer it with mud and water. Within a few weeks, good quality manure is generated from that, which is used to soil the papaya tree. I have also placed an old bathtub on my terrace. I have soiled it and it is now a beautiful kitchen garden where I grow tomatoes, chillies, radish etc.

I try not to use chemicals and keep everything natural. Often, I even scatter petals from dried out flowers on the roots of the plant. It automatically dissolves in the soil and makes it healthier.

As a child, I was always attracted to plants. Even now, I do not just place plants anywhere randomly. Everything is calculated and thoughtfully placed to meet my vision. Gardening through waste management has helped me immensely in achieving a healthy mind and body, all the while reducing pollution and benefiting the environment.

Jet Demolition company managing director Joe Brinkmann (left) briefs his team in front of the Jains Coral Cove... Read More

Ever since the demolition of the illegal apartment complexes at Maradu was ordered, apprehensions had been raised by the residents on the safety aspect. They were mainly sceptical about the impact the demolition would have on their houses. TOI speaks to Joe Brinkmann , managing director of Jet Demolition, the premier South African demolition company that assists Edifice Engineering, which demolishes three of the four apartment complexes in Maradu — Jains Coral Cove, Holy Faith H2O and Golden Kayaloram — about the demolition and the risk involved.

Can you detail about the risk involved in the demolition of the buildings?

Well, we cannot say that any implosion project is fully safe because a risk aspect is always there. We would rather call it challenging than risky. But what we do is minimizing the risk so that the impact or damage caused is near to zero. We can assure you that the apprehensions of the public are mere imaginations. We will carry out the demolition safely if the people comply with the guidelines promptly.

The chance for an accident is extremely remote as this is an implosion where collapse behaviour of the building will be controlled. The gravity will push the entire structure down into itself and there is no chance of the building going sideways. Once the implosion is done you can see a pile of concrete up to 25 metres height at the building site.

There are three layers of protection. Right around the columns where the explosives are fixed, we have around five layers of wire mesh. On top of that there is a five-layer geotextile cover. We call this the source protection which will contain the rubble from being thrown to distance. All those floors where the explosives are fixed are covered with geotextiles.

As the secondary protection, we have the perimeter curtains, again made out of the geotextile, on all sides of the buildings. The tertiary protection is the wind curtain (made out of geotextiles) on those sides where we have houses or building. These curtains will be installed along the boundary lines of nearby buildings. Because, the falling building will displace the air to surroundings along with the dust and these curtains will stop it.

What about the vibration impact of the implosion?

Implosion will be done in such a way that the building does not fall down directly on the ground creating high seismic shock. Here the buildings will crumble down and will have a waterfall effect. Moreover, the explosives are not placed on the ground but on the building columns, hence there won’t be any direct impact or transfer of energy directly to the earth.

The buildings are situated on marshy land. Will it affect the demolition?

The soil investigation reports show that all these buildings are situated in soft soil, which is alluvium. I think the soft soil will give us an advantage here because they are good at absorbing the impact. Hence the vibration will be much lesser compared to hard soil.

Which among the three buildings is more challenging?

We think bringing down Golden Kayaloram is the real challenge because of an anganwadi that is situated in less than 10 metres. We were given the liberty to ignore the school’s safety but we took it as a challenge. We have taken special precautions and extra work to protect the school. We will split the building into two and it will fall in two directions.

With only a few days left for the demolition, what’s your advice to the people staying near the exclusion zones?

I request the people to comply with evacuation guidelines and move to safe places rather than taking risks. Dust will be the only concern . Take measures like closing the windows and doors to sort out the dust factor. They can keep their LPG cylinders, home appliances and even vehicles at the houses and no need to take them away. It is better to cover the well mouths with some sheets to prevent the dust getting settled down in the drinking water.

251,['8/01/2020'],Nagpur: One-day strike by trade unions today; to oppose NRC-NPR,"This story is from January 8, 2020

NAGPUR: Work in central and some of the state government offices is expected to be hit on Wednesday as trade unions, barring Sangh Parivar-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), have called for a one-day strike.

The unions will also be raising a banner against the proposed national register of citizenship (NRC) and national population register (NPR), said a press release issued by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).

The CITU press release said Shiv Sena-backed unions have also supported the strike. The agitation is mainly against the changes in various labour laws by the central government. The unions will also raise farmers’ cause and NRC-NPR issues and come up with a 12-point charter of demands.

Major offices where work is expected to be affected include banks, Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), LIC, apart from various central and state government units in the city.

The strike may not have a major impact in the ordnance factories as BMS, which has a dominant presence in the factories, has not supported the strike call over the NRC-NPR. There are three ordnance factories in Vidarbha region employing a considerable workforce.

Shriram Batwe of Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), a BMS-affiliated union in ordnance factory here, said even as other causes will be supported, the union will not take part in the strike as NRC issue will also be raised during the agitation.

Apart from unions in government organizations, some of the farmers’ unions, associations of anganwadi workers and medical representatives will be taking part in the strike.

253,['8/01/2020'],Tree plantation done in casual manner,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Wires seen penetrating the stems or the trunks of the trees

Surat: Barbed wires and paver blocks around trees have an adverse effect on their growth, but little thought is given to this aspect by the local authorities. Paver blocks in particular because they prevent recharging of groundwater, sources said. Karamveer Bhatt, an expert in tree protection, said, “Paver blocks prevent roots from penetrating the ground to get required nutrients and water supply. There is very little space left for the roots to grow and spread. In bigger trees where trunks are hardened, barbed wires don’t cause much damage, but in trees with soft stem this means a slow death for them.”

Trees with barbed wires can be found at Napura, Athwalines, Adjan and Pal. Here the wires can be seen penetrating the stems or the trunks of the trees. Barbed wires are put to protect the trees from animals. City light, New City Light and Pal have trees with paver blocks around them. “It is estimated that there are over 25,000 trees which are barbed wired and their full area covered with paver blocks in the city,” Bhatt said.

Planting wrong trees at wrong place also damages them. The civic body’s garden department plants trees at places where there are overhead wires or hoardings. “At such places, short growing trees need to be planted. A tree grows by self-balancing itself. Haphazard cutting also disturbs a tree’s balance, increasing its chances of collapsing and uprooting,” Bhatt said.

“It is wrong to say we are callous. We plant trees in a scientific manner and ensure there is enough space for their roots to spread,” said an officer of Surat Municipal Corporation.

Rajkot: Durgadevi Bhanjdev (45), daughter of erstwhile ruler of Virpur state in Rajkot, Thakur Pushpendrasinh Jadeja , has accused her cousin of trying to usurp her portion the family’s ancestral house ‘Virpur State House’ in the city.

The police on Monday evening registered a case of encroachment of property against Devendrasinh Jadeja, cousin of Durgadevi and nephew of Pushpendrasinh; and his mother Chandakumariba Jadeja. The Rajkot crime branch is investigating the case.

According to case details, the ancestral house ‘Virpur State House’ located on Moti Tanki Chowk was occupied by Pushpendrasinh and his brother Yaduvendrasinh Jadeja’s family. It was divided into half, with both families having separate entrance to the house.

After Pushpendrasinh’s son died in 2013, he and his wife used to live alone in the huge house. In August 2016, Pushpendrasinh made a gift deed and transferred his portion of the house in the name of Durgadevi, who was not settled in Bhuvaneshwar in Odisha. The gift deed was registered with the sub-registrar of property in August 22, 2016.

After Pushpendrasinh’s death on July 25, 2019, Durgadevi took her mother Alaknandadevi with her to Odhisha. In December last year, Durgadevi came to know that her cousin Devendrasinh and his mother Chandakumariba had encroached upon their portion of the ancestral house. So she returned to Rajkot on December 18, 2019. But she was not allowed to enter the premises by the accused.

Durgadevi approached the Rajkot police commissioner and submitted an application against Devendrasinh and Chandakumariba.

Both the families had been in talks since then over the property rights. As there was not decision, police on Monday evening registered an FIR against Devendrasinh and Chandakumariba with the city crime branch and launched investigation.

MYSURU: Even though the health department conducts massive promotion drives about birth control programmes, men in Mysuru district seem reluctant to undergo sterilisation surgery . In many cases, men averse to it force their wives to do it instead.

To motivate men to go in for it, the government has announced incentives. Only six men from the district opted for it from April to November 2019, while 3,012 laparoscopic, 2,531 minilap and 2,163 Postpartum Sterilisation (PPS) tubectomies were conducted on women.

The number of vasectomies in the district has come come down over the years. In 2012-13, 39 men underwent vasectomies while there were 9,132 tubectomies.

The health department officials claim that despite awareness campaigns that vasectomies are safe and simple when compared to tubectomies, men avoid it due to fear of losing potency and failure in surgeries.

“We highlight that there will be no stitch after surgery and the patient can go home in less than an hour, and be active in sexual activity, there are still false beliefs which make men stay away. They fear losing potency,” a health officer said.

Mysuru District Health Officer Dr R Venkatesh said: “There is a fear among men that after surgery there will be side-effects like scrotal haematoma or scrotal swelling or loss of interest in day-to-day work. Even though some men want to have it, his friends or relatives will misguide him and he stays away. There are very rare failures in the surgery. Government employees who have the operation get an extra increment.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: The phansi kotha ( hanging courtyard ) at Tihar Jail has been restructured to hold the weight of all four Nirbhaya case convicts during the hanging process.Jail authorities got an additional support structure constructed to allow the nooses of the four death row inmates to be fixed at intervals. The moving hatch on which the convicts would be made to stand has also been redesigned. Apart from this, an earthmover was used to extend the well below the gallows.Sources said the hanging courtyard and the gallows were constructed in the early 1950s. They consist of a metal crossbar erected on two concrete pillars. Loops have been made for the hanging rope. “As the metal bar weakens due to weathering, we have tested its strength with the help of experts. Additional construction was done to increase the strength and length of the bar to hold the weight of four men,” said a jail official.Eight ropes prepared by prisoners at Buxar Jail, known as manila ropes, have been procured by the authorities. Sources said the ropes made of soft cotton and butter or wax are used to keep it soft, yet strong. A day before the hanging, the hangman will brush wax or butter onto the rope to allow the noose to fall smoothly on the neck of the death row inmate.“The rope is made in such a way that it doesn’t cut through the neck of the convict. While hanging, multiple knots ahead of the noose are greased with butter so that it gradually untangles and presses against the neck of the convict giving a less painful death,” jail sources said. A trial for this was conducted on the existing gallows to check whether it would be able to withstand the weight.It is mandatory to execute all the four convicts at the same time, said jail sources. If one of the convicts falls sick or unconscious due to anxiety, the execution would be called off.The four inmates will be shifted to jail number 3 and kept in different cells. Each of them have been allowed to meet their family members at least once in the past fortnight. “We have not noticed any behavioral changes, except for occasional bouts of anxiety among the convicts. They have been meeting their lawyer to discuss their case,” said a jail officer.In Video: Gallows recast to hold Nirbhaya convicts' weight",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73149999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-677765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/phansi-kotha-at-tihar-recast-to-bear-the-weight-of-four-convicts/articleshow/73146902.cms

Nagpur: The NMC’s town planning department has decided to revise development and building plan sanction charges by up to 60%.

The department’s proposal on revision of charges will be tabled before the standing committee meeting to be held on January 7. The civic administration has also submitted 59 other proposals collectively valued at Rs44.75 crore.

The NMC’s general body had approved Rs15,000-Rs75,000 per sq MTR for building sanction plan but the department proposes to levy Rs24,200-Rs 1 lakh per sq MTR, which amounts to a near 60% hike.

Similar rates were also proposed for stocking building material. The administration has proposed to levy Rs24,200 per sq MTR up to Rs75,000. However, the rate passed by the general body was Rs15,000 per sq MTR to Rs50,000, the proposal stated.

It also proposes to revise tree deposit. The department has proposed to double the tree deposit from existing Rs500 to Rs1,000.

Along with this, the town planning department has also proposed to regularize unauthorized constructions like enclosure of balcony into rooms, to exclude staircase, passage, lobby, lift etc from carpet area by paying premium of 5% of the Ready Reckoner value of the property. The existing charge is 4%.

However, the department has proposed no change of fees for regularization of unauthorized construction of floors. The proposal stated to regularize the floor relaxation by levying existing 4% on the construction of property below 180 sq MTR area for all residential, commercial and industrial categories.

The department also proposes to double the fees to connect sewage network while giving sanction for construction of any new properties. It also proposed to double the charges for division or amalgamation of properties.

The proposed revised rates will also be applicable in the jurisdiction of Nagpur Improvement Trust as the state government on August 27, 2019 had appointed NMC as planning authority.

Even though the NMC’s financial condition is poor, the sports department has proposed to organize Adiwasi Mahanatya by spending Rs30 lakh at Futala lake. Besides, the social welfare department proposes to hold women entrepreneurs’ expo at Reshimbagh ground from January 19 to 26 and sought a nod to sanction Rs91.78 lakh for the purpose. The social welfare department also proposed to allocate Rs1.87 crore for purchasing e-rickshaws to be allocated to 70 handicapped unemployed youths.

MYSURU: Retired English professor R Purnima has been creating awareness about neuropsychiatric disorders by performing plays , not just across the state but also in different states in the country.

People are aware about fever, dengue, cold and other common diseases but they’re not much aware about neuropsychiatric disorders. Taking note of this, Purnima directed the play ‘Stage Chemistry: Neuropsychiatric Disorders’ on May 21, 2018 and the 240th show was held on December 12. She has been involved in one-woman show 200 times. She also imparts free English coaching classes to government school and college students. She retired from the English department at Manasagangothri in 2016.

She said: “Nearly two decades ago, the umbrella of Children’s Literary Club, a voluntary organisation which I founded had done a programme titled ‘Talented Madmen’. In 2018 summer, I got the idea for this play about disorders. Besides a keen interest in nurturing English theatre in Mysuru, I’m interested in interdisciplinary studies. The play, with several short scenes, is interdisciplinary in nature. The main objective is to make the target group understand, accept and motivate them to get involved, to facilitate growth, promote mental health, and achieve catharsis, so that the world becomes a better place to live in for the affected. Besides English-medium students, those in government, government-aided high schools, higher primary schools, PU colleges in Kannada medium watched and responded positively to the play.”

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government is taking various steps to simplify taxation system and eliminate harassment of honest taxpayers .

Addressing an event organised by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), the finance minister said the government is open to suggestions for the betterment of GST filing system .

Based on suggestions received from various stakeholders, the government is taking steps towards simplification of taxation system, she added.

In a bid to curb harassment of taxpayers, she said, a faceless e-assessment scheme was launched in October to eliminate interface between an assessing officer and a taxpayer.

The tax department has implemented a computer-generated document identification number (DIN) to ensure greater transparency and accountability in tax administration.

The DIN system, which became operative from 1 October 2019, will apply to all kind of communications from the income tax department, whether it is related to assessment, appeals, investigation, penalty and rectification, among others.

This development will also help taxpayers to detect fake notices and letters as the notice would be verifiable on the department's e-filing portal.

Besides, the finance minister said, such cases have to be closed within 30 days. She also said that there would be shopping festival held across the country soon.

In a bid to boost trade, Sitharaman had in September last year announced Dubailike mega shopping festivals in India, starting March 2020.

Mahesh Savani

Surat: Four persons were arrested by Umra police for extortion and kidnapping a 65-year-old builder on Tuesday. However, main accused Mahesh Savani, a reputed businessman, is yet to be arrested and has disappeared. Police sources said Savani is likely to approach high court to request it for quashing of the complaint against him.

Those arrested were Gopal Thummar, Ankit Savani, Arpan alias Appu Limbachiya and Chirag Timbadiya.

Savani and five others were booked at Umra police station on Saturday for extortion and kidnapping Gautam Patel, a builder, from his residence at Parle Point. Initially Savani’s men had gone to Patel’s residence to ask him to come along. When Patel refused, Savani himself took Patel to his office from the victim’s bungalow in his car.

Patel was dropped back home by Savani’s men in a car. Meanwhile, police arrived at the bungalow as Patel’s wife had already alerted cops and detained the four persons. They were taken to police station from where they disappeared mysteriously when the offence was being registered.

Vadodara: On the call of the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR), all zonal unions of NFIR including Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS) have decided to hold ‘Rail Bachao Sangoshti’ (conference) from January 8 to 10.

The sangoshti is being held to protest against heavy outsourcing, privatization and selling of national assets of Indian Railways including railway colonies in all divisions, corporatization of production units like Raibareli Coach Factory, Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, diesel locomotive works, Varanasi, Diesel loco modernization works, Patiala, integral coach factories at Patiala and Chennai among others.

“It is necessary for NFIR and railwaymen because at all costs, unions would like to protect this kind of attitude taken by the government,” said J G Mahurkar, general secretary of WRMS and vice-president of NFIR.

“Other important topics to be discussed include railway’s performance, role of rail workforce, railway ministry’s policies, capital investment and financial health of railways,” he said.

The earning side of the railways will also be discussed during the sanghoshti. “NFIR is on the opinion that railways has been incurring losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 crore every year on account of coaching services being provided below the operational cost while the railway ministry has been indifferent on this vital matter,” he said.

Railway minister Piyush Goyal will be holding a meeting with 300 delegates of NFIR and AIFR on January 16 to sort out issues with the recognised federations.

267,['8/01/2020'],The legends of Tasker Town’s ‘jail school’,"BENGALURU: The people of the neighbourhood call it the “ladies jail”. It seems that the name is well deserved. It’s an old building complex - clearly built well before independence. The walls are old stone, and solidly thick. The windows are barred. The dark corridors are flanked by high doors along their lengths.This is not a jail, though its inmates might make that comparison. It is the Government Telugu High School - also known as the Jail School - in Tasker Town near Shivaji Circle in Shivajinagar . If you go in there on a weekday, you’ll probably see over 300 students who studied there, sequestered in classrooms that resemble jail cells. If ever a building did duty as a prison, this is it, you may think. But nobody knows for sure.“Everyone refers to this as a ladies prison complex from the British era which was later converted to a government office under the BBMP and now a school,” says Veerabhadrappa, principal of the Telugu school.I decided to find out more. The first stop was the Karnataka Prisons Department. Records there provide information - in voluminous detail - about the Bangalore Central Prison complex which is now the Freedom Park. But there was no information about this women’s prison. Further searches in city records for more information about the Tasker Town building - in books and maps at the Mythic Society, the state archives and the State Central Library in Cubbon Park - also drew a blank. The detailed seven-piece map of Bangalore City and cantonment, dating back to 1884, which is considered a civic treasure by historians for its accuracy, shows Shivaji Circle in detail but there is no information on the so-called prison.When all my attempts at primary research failed, I did what I should have done in the beginning - consult historians whose areas of expertise included Bengaluru’s history. I reached the Indian Council of Historial Research (ICHR), near the Mysore Bank circle, and met Dr SK Aruni, the regional director of ICHR here. “Yes, I remember reading about the building. It is of Indian architecture and is possible a 100-year-old structure. It served as a zenana, a reserved area for women of the household which remains at bay for men mainly outsiders,” Aruni said.A senior researcher who has studied old Bangalore history and its temple and architecture, Aruni believes that the structure could have been owned by some rich Muslim traders who had flourished in the cantonment area that was dominated by Europeans and British defence personnel decades ago before independence. “There are no records of a prison or a sub-jail in the Shivajinagar area apart from the well-recorded history of a small prison cum judicial complex which functioned from inside the present day police commissionerate during the British days,” says Aruni who believes that the Shivajinagar structure could have got the jail tag from people in the locality referring to it as a place where women were kept away from the men and over the years, public imagination turned the cause of the confinement of women in the building from cultural to punitive.There aren’t many records on the school building, something that has sharpened the curiosity of both locals and historical researchers. Government records show that the stone structure was sold or taken over by the government post-independence and has served as a school since the mid 1970s. “In the late 90s, the Block Education Office of the State Education Department which was then functioning inside Mayo Hall was shifted to the present school building in Tasker Town. The structure also doubled as a school textbooks godown. The Government Telugu School , started in 1993 was functioning from a building on OPH Road in Shivajinagar ,” says M. Venkataramanappa, a retired Head Master, who served at the Telugu School.In 2006, the Block Education Office shifted out of the colonial structure to Kamaraj Road to make way for the Government Telugu High School which witnessed a growing student number. However, the primary section of the school still functions out of the structure on OPH Road.Suresh Moona, city historian and author, who has researched and written extensively on the Bangalore cantonment area says the zenana angle needs a further investigation. “The possibility of such a zenana in the area is slim. Who was the rich trader who built such a big structure nearly a 100 years ago to house the women. The famous names who lived in Shivajinagar have been recorded in detail in history texts and we need to find out who could have owned this stone building,” says Moona.But that, again, is the tragedy of Bengaluru. It’s said that, Indians lack a sense of history. If our own governments lack records - despite asking for reams of forms to be filled for each interaction - to identify the background of a significant piece of real estate, it may well be true.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73141400,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-71911,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/the-legends-of-tasker-towns-jail-school/articleshow/73141402.cms

Rajkot: A bakery owner in Junagadh , who had converted to Sikhism two years ago , has lodged a complaint against a garments shop owner for allegedly threatening to disrupt the Amrit Sanchar ritual at a gurudwara.

Girish Tilwani, who embraced Sikhism along with his brother, has been offering prayers and service at the gurudwara. He told police that ever since 2017, shop owner Karan Dakshina had been harbouring a grudge against him for religious conversion. While Dakshina had been frequently hurling jibes at him for the past two years, Tilwani had preferred not to hit back. On January 1, Tilwani had gone to see off some guests at the railway station. When he came out, Dakshina again confront him and started hurling abuses in the presence of some Sikh people from Amritsar accompanying Tilwani. He then allegedly hit Tilwani on his head with a pipe, police said. Dakshina was arrested the same night.

On Monday night, Dakshina, who was released on bail, went to Tilwani's house and demanded Rs five lakh ever year, failing which he would disrupt Amrit Sanchar ritual at the gurudwara.

Tilwani again approached the police and Dakshina was arrested. He was booked for extortion and criminal intimidation.

Amrit Sanchar refers to the Sikh baptism ceremony that was established in 1699 when Guru Gobind Singh first initiated five followers of his faith and then was baptised himself by them.

Mysuru: Suspecting corruption in the selection of gazetted probationers of 2015th batch, Karnataka State Backward Classes Awareness Forum president K S Shivaramu on Tuesday demanded a judicial probe into the alleged wrongdoing and sought revaluation of answer scripts of candidates.

Recently, KPSC announced provisional list of 428 selected candidates who wrote the exams in 2015. But bright and ‘eligible’ candidates have failed to make it to the final list and this has raised suspicion about the entire process of selection of candidates, claimed Shivaramu.

Nearly 35% candidates selected are among only two communities which both put together had only 36 reserved seats. “This has made us suspect something amiss in the selection. KPSC authorities also have cut down the number of days to raise objection. According to rules, a minimum of 15 days time should have been given, but here only 7 days are given,” he said.

Interestingly, it has come to our notice that expert valuators have not been hired to evaluate answerscripts. Instead, they have been assessed by pre-university lectures. Another major irregularity is digital evaluation of scripts and the method in which they have been done. Usually, evaluators have to set passwords on their own and close the scripts after the evaluation. Here, passwords have been set by the KPSC. There is every chance of misuse as passwords were with the authorities.

There is also information that KPSC members visited the valuation centres several times.

Moreover, the time taken to announce the results is three years from the day of examination. Even there is violation in inviting more candidates for interview beyond prescribed ratio, said Shivaramu, who has threated to launch a state-wide protest.

Dharmaj Day has become an annual feature of the lush green Charotar belt of central Gujarat

Vadodara/ Anand: As NRI-rich Dharmaj town of Anand district gears up to host 14th Dharmaj Day celebrations on Sunday, the town will be painted ‘pink’ to celebrate women power.

Dharmaj Day which has become an annual feature of the lush green Charotar belt of Central Gujarat this year is dedicated to daughters and daughter-in-laws.

“We are calling it DD for DD,” said Rajesh Patel, part of team Dharmaj, which has been organising Dharmaj Day celebrations as an attempt to connect generation next of NRI with their roots since 2007.

So, theme colour for the forthcoming programme is pink. And it promises to be an all women show – starting from women who welcome the guests to the ones who will occupy the dais and also those who will be conferred awards for their contribution to society.

“We will be also unveiling the ‘vanshavali’ or the family tree which for the first time will include names of daughters and daughter-in-laws of the community. Usually, the community tree just bear names of sons or grandsons. Daughters are not given their due in family or community trees as such a space is left blank. But we are revamping this. We had started efforts for this last year itself,” said Patel.

A majority of Patels of Dharmaj are descendants of Ranga Patel, the patriarch, who had migrated from Virol village near Sojitra, to the present day Dharmaj before 900 years.

The drive to include name of female members of each family was launched during the international women’s day celebrations last year by women of team Dharmaj all dressed in pink with forms which were also filled in pink letters.

“After we launched online link to reach out to members of our town spread across the globe on December 8, we have collected 430 forms. We have offline data of 11,000 individuals,” he said.

The town will also be felicitating Trupti Patel, the first female civil engineer from Asian community in UK and currently president of Hindu Forum, UK with Dharmaj Gaurav award.

She carries with her 30 years experience in the field of highways, traffic and transportation having managed various divisions at Salford City Council , Manchester City Council and Three Rivers District Council.

Also, two female doctors and sisters from the same father – Dr Rupande Patel and Dr Gorande Kanabar, currently settled in US and London, will be felicitated with Dharmaj Jyoti award.

Luminous 11 a Sea Shell Art Exhibition by Sreeja Kalappurakkal

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sreeja Kalappurakkal , a self-trained artist from Nilambur, who is known for arts works on feather and stone, is back with a seashell art exhibition. Titled as ‘Luminous 11’, the exhibition began at Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery at the Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan on Tuesday.

The exhibition features around 130 paintings done on seashells. Paintings are done in acrylic on carefully selected shells collected from different coasts of south India, and each frame depicts the beauty of nature from different angles. Also on display are replicas of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and Vadakkumnathan Temple, Thrissur, made of seashells.

For Sreeja, what began as a childhood hobby became a serious passion later in her life. She, who calls herself as a passionate traveller, feels art in anything and everything and finds inspiration from tough and unique materials like feathers, stone and seashells.

“In 2016, while I was doing works of stone art, I started collecting shells for seashell arts. For paintings, I specifically select mother of pearl shells. The recent and last year’s flood had affected the availability of shells. Another challenge is painting the shell as like a marble piece it won’t absorb direct paint. So I have to give it a primer coating and also dry it in sunlight,” she said. The largest ones among the painted shells measure up to 40cm long and 25cm wide.

To make the expo totally eco-friendly, wooden frames and wooden sheets are used to fix the shell paintings at the gallery.

On display are seashell arts portraying ‘Nilavilakku’, butterfly-shaped shells which depicts two red parrots, elephant tusks, water lilies on butterfly-shaped shells, swans, waterfalls and pictures of 2018 and 2019 Kerala floods.

“It took around four months for me to complete the work on Padmanabhaswamy Temple. But it gives me immense pleasure when people praise my hard work. I am also planning to work on seashell models of Thrissur Pooram with Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu temples on my expo scheduled on March,” Sreeja added.

The expo, which was inaugurated by V K Prasanth, MLA, will be on till Friday. Gauri Parvathi Bhai of Travancore royal family unveiled the seashell sculpture of Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The exhibition will be open from 10am to 6pm.

Sreeja’s earlier works on feather and miniature paintings done on stones had also won critical acclaim.

VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday slapped the highest fine ever for reckless disposal of garbage. A man whose video throwing garbage into the Vishwamitri river had gone viral landed in trouble after his identity was established by the civic body.

The video recorded on a mobile phone by an alert citizen showed a man standing in a mini truck throwing bags full of garbage into Vishwamitri river near the Vadsar bridge.

The citizen had also recorded the garbage bags flowing in the river.

As the video reached VMC officials, they swung into action and identified the owner of the vehicle using its registration number.

The civic body slapped a fine of Rs one lakh for the act as disposal of garbage in a waterbody attracts very high fine.

Assistant municipal commissioner Bhupendra Sheth said that the persons who was slapped the fine was a transporter. “He had a social function at his residence and a lot of food was left over. He had filled this in bags and disposed it in the river on Monday morning,” said Sheth.

Sheth said that the transporter who had his office on the Gotri Road paid the fine on Tuesday itself when the notice was issued to him. The notice had warned the transporter that if he did not pay the fine, action could be taken against him under the Gujarat Provincial Municipalities Act as well as the Environment Protection Act.

According to Sheth, the man was not aware about the consequences of his act.

“We collect garbage for a small charge after such events. He could also have contacted any NGO that collected food left over after incident and fed the needy,” he said.

Representative image

KOCHI: Highly-modernized bunks should be provided to rehabilitate street vendors considering the importance of Kochi as a tourist destination, said the high court . The court has now directed Ernakulam collector to convene a meeting of stakeholders to chalk out a plan.

Justice A Muhamed Mustaque issued the directive after considering a total of 11 petitions seeking proper measures to rehabilitate street vendors within the limits of Kochi corporation.

A total of 2,122 street vendors were identified and approved by the corporation council following a court directive. Of the lot, areas were identified by corporation for rehabilitating 1,535 vendors. Concurrence of traffic regulatory authority is required for rehabilitation, it said.

Corporation, which informed the court that it is not able to identify more area, has suggested that the issue of rehabilitation can be resolved if some of the areas under the control of GCDA are utilized.

The court was also told that the nature of the bunk also needs serious consideration as many vendors are engaged in operating ‘thattukada’ (roadside food outlets) and there were complaints of nuisance and pollution by nearby residents. An amicus curiae appointed by the court submitted that an architect has come forward to design the bunks for free.

Regarding the nature of the bunks, the court said in the interim order, “It is to be noted that hygienic conditions will have to be maintained... The bunk must be of particular dimensions... The highly-modernized bunks will have to be erected considering the importance of Kochi as a tourist destination.” The court then ordered the collector to work out a plan to implement the rehab scheme and file a report by January 28.

MUMBAI: A forensic science expert on Tuesday denied the defence suggestion that his work relating to the ‘ digital superimposition ’ process done in the Sheena Bora murder case is amateurish and not befitting scientific process.

Last week, the witness, the 60th in the murder trial , had deposed that with ‘digital superimposition’, he had concluded that a skull recovered in the case is a ‘100%’ match with Sheena’s ‘smiling’ photographs. During cross-examination by accused Indrani Mukerjea’s lawyer, he denied that his opinion was erroneous. The witness also denied the defence suggestion that he had prepared a false report to oblige the CBI.

Earlier in the hearing, when asked if he had done a course in forensic odontology, the witness said he had not taken a specific course. “The knowledge of dental science relating to teeth is a part of MBBS MD course, therefore I know forensic odontology.”

Responding to the defence, the witness said it was not ‘perfectly’ correct to say that courts have considered facial reconstruction and cranio facial superimposition as useful, but that they are not to be relied upon by itself to determine victims’ identity. tnn

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The ball has been set rolling for the Modi government's second attempt to divest in Air India (AI). Union home minister Amit Shah-led GoM on Tuesday cleared the expression of interest (EoI) along with the share purchase agreement (SPA) for the debt-laden carrier's privatisation and these two documents are likely to be issued for bidders this month, said a senior official.

The last GoM meeting had taken place in September 2019. It had then approved complete exit from AI, AI Express and also selling AI's stake in JV AISATS. A voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and debt restructuring plan for AI were also cleared then.

Losing almost Rs 25 crore daily, the Maharaja's total debt is over to Rs 74,000 crore, which includes nearly Rs 60,000 crore of aircraft and working capital debt and Rs 14,000 crore of net current liabilities or payables. A special purpose vehicle - AI Asset Holding - has taken on Rs 29,464 crore of the airline's debt along with some assets.

Unlike the last failed bid when bidders for AI, AI Express and AISATS were expected to take over debt of Rs 24,576 crore and current liabilities of Rs 8,816 crore, this time the debt burden for potential buyers is likely to be mainly limited to aircraft loan.

Air India's net loss in 2018-19 was around Rs 8,556 crore. The airline has now virtually run out of funds and is finding hard to sustain itself.

Aviation minister HS Puri said AI will keep running till it is privatised.

The government is trying its best to come out with terms of sale that investors find attractive enough to buy the Maharaja. Among the likely suitors are Tata Group-Singapore Airlines JV Vistara and IndiGo . Some international airlines are also learnt to be looking closely at the final terms of sale and may join the fray if they find the same making business sense.

The civic body was called for taking care of the stray dogs at the site ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on October 31 last year to mark the first anniversary of the inauguration of SoU. Two agencies working for the civic body – the Vadodara Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (VSPCA) and Humane Society International (HSI) – were roped in for the task.

The agencies have submitted bills totalling to Rs 3.62lakh to the civic body for the work done there. The VMC administration has put up a proposal before the standing committee seeking a nod to make the payment to the agencies.

RAJKOT: A Dhoraji court of Rajkot sentenced a 39-year-old man to life imprisonment for rape and abduction of a 12-year-old girl. Additional sessions judge H A Dave also imposed fine of Rs 14,000 on accused Amrut alias Raju Thakor and ordered the government to pay compensation to the rape survivor.

The trial in the case was completed in a record time of a little over two months, said assistant public prosecutor Kartikey Parekh.

According to cased details, Thakor, who used to work as a casual labourer in Upleta town, had lured the minor girl saying that he would take her shopping. He along with his wife took the girl to Dhoraji on August 14, 2019.

The girl was carrying a piece of paper with her father’s phone number written on it. But Thakor snatched it from her after reaching Dhoraji. He then too the girl to a village in Rapar Kutch where he raped her after his wife went to sleep in the night. Police said that Thakor continued to rape the girl every night. But one night his wife woke up and caught him in the act. She called the police and got Thakor arrested.

Meanwhile, the girl’s father also lodged a kidnapping complaint on August 28 last year and the police started search for Thakor.

Kutch police informed the Upleta police of the missing girl, who later informed her parents. Thakor was booked for rape, abduction and relevant sections of POCSO Act.

Assistant public prosecutor Kartikey Parekh told TOI, “The court observed that the accused had destroyed life of a young girl and sentenced Thakor to life imprisonment.”

Vadodara: The Vadodara unit of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) on Tuesday staged protest against its rival student outfit – the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) for Sunday’s violence in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in Delhi and the one that Ahmedabad witnessed on Tuesday.

Following the clash between ABVP and NSUI members at Ahmedabad, student leaders linked with the NSUI staged protest at the main building of MS University’s Faculty of Commerce and later at Kalaghoda circle.

The NSUI leaders burnt posters of ABVP, raised slogans against the RSS-affiliated student outfit and demanded action against the perpetrators who they said were armed with sticks and other sharp-edged weapons attacked their workers in Ahmedabad.

“This clearly reflects their mentality. We are demanding strong action against the perpetrators. They were the same person who had attacked a peaceful gathering at Sabarmati Ashram before a couple of days,” said NSUI leader and former general secretary of MSU Students Union Vraj Patel.

“ABVP goons are creating violence at campuses across the country but police is watching as mute spectators,” said NSUI president Devang Thakor.

The student leaders later were detained by Sayajigunj police for staging protest at Kalaghoda circle without necessary permission.

284,['8/01/2020'],City registers steepest fall in vehicle sales in Gujarat,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Vadodara: Vadodara witnessed steepest fall in registration of vehicles compared to all cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot in 2019.

Registration of vehicles in Vadodara city (GJ-06) registered a drop of 72 % compared to 2018 figure. While the two-wheeler segment registered a decline of 68.54 % in 2019, sales of car dipped by 75.24%.

Compared to 2017, car sales registered a sharp decline of 75 % in 2019 in the city. Against 28,000 vehicle registrations in 2017, the city registered only 26,000 vehicles in 2019.

Main reason for the drastic decline in car sales is economic slowdown. “People have been finding it tough to manage their home budgets. I think, parking issues and traffic drives too have contributed to the decline,” said an official from Regional Transport Office (RTO).

Shwetal Patel of a car dealership said, “Sentiments have dropped due to economic slowdown. Also, the sales have been impacted due to the shift from BS-IV cars to BS-VI cars. At local level, infrastructure of Vadodara is really not supportive as there are traffic jams. Multi car buying is not happening.”

Nikhil Chawla, director of two-wheelers dealership, added, “The automobile sector across the nation is witnessing a decline. Vadodara has a mix of chemical, fertilizers and other industrial sectors. Plus, there is salaried class population in bigger numbers. But sales in Vadodara witnessed a decline due to floods and excess rainfall which impacted the purchasing power of buyers from the rural belt.”

286,['8/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Release of water for rabi crops halted a month ahead of schedule,"This story is from January 8, 2020

PUNE: The release of water for rabi crops from Khadakwasla dam was stopped on Tuesday, about a month before the scheduled end of rotation.

The water rotation started on December 15 and was expected to continue for 60 days until mid-February. However, water release continued for only over 21 days.

The state irrigation department has said that water will now be released from the dam based on ‘demand and supply’ principle, instead of continuous discharge. The experiment of demand-based release is expected to save more water in reservoirs thereby making the resource available during the summer months, the department has stated.

About 4 TMC water is expected to be released from Khadakwasla dam into the canal during the winter rotation. The discharge will restart after the department receives fresh demand for water release from the farmers.

“We have stopped the release of water from Mutha canal,” an official from the state irrigation department said on Tuesday.

A senior irrigation department official added, “About 2.17 TMC water has been released in 21 days of rotation between December 15 and January 6. A review of water availability was undertaken over the last few days in which it was observed that the demand for water from the farming areas of the district was met. This prompted the department to discontinue water release before the scheduled end.”

The water release from Khadakwasla dam, underway for the last 21 days, was part of the first winter rotation for crops. Every year, water is released in two rotations for Rabi crops. This year, the first rotation was delayed by almost two months.

An official said, “The first rotation begins around October 15. However, the extended rainfall last year postponed water release up to December 15 and it has also been stopped ahead of the scheduled time. We may restart the release after 15 to 20 days if the demand is raised. The remaining 2 TMC water is expected to flow out in the second rotation,” the official added.

The collective water stock in the four dams supplying water to the city was 23.5 TMC (80%) on Tuesday. Last year on the same day, the collective stock stood at 17.3 TMC (60%). The four dams have 29.15 TMC storage capacity.

At the canal committee meeting of Khadakwasla irrigation circle held last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said that the city will receive adequate water during the summer months.

Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will get a fresh survey conducted for improvement of seven traffic junctions in the city. The state government has already given an in-principle approval for construction of six flyovers in the city.

The state government had sought details of flyovers that could be constructed within a cost of Rs 50crore each from the VMC last month. The VMC had suggested seven different locations where it could construct flyovers to streamline traffic movement.

Subsequently, the state government has given an in-principle approval for six flyovers in the city. The flyovers will cost around Rs 270crore. The state government will also release 10 per cent of this amount to the civic body as grants. VMC will have to bear any extra expenses involved in construction of the flyovers.

In wake of the development, the VMC is looking to get surveys conducted by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) at seven junctions. These include the Vrundavan Crossroads, Khodiyarnagar Crossroads, Sardar Estate junction, Sangam Crossroads, Vasna Road Crossroads, Sama pond crossroads and Manekpark Crossroads.

VMC will be paying Rs 26lakh and GST to CRRI for the study. The study will be completed in three months. A proposal in this regard has been put before the standing committee of the civic body.

Pune: The Congress, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena ( MNS ) and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have jointly approached Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) demanding that water closure should not be enforced every Thursday.

In a memorandum submitted to the water supply department, the leaders of the parties said that the administration should carry out maintenance in a better manner instead of imposing water cuts across the city. The leaders have claimed that although PMC announces water cut for a day, several areas fail to receive water supply the next day due to poor distribution system.

Rupali Thombre of MNS said that an extensive audit was required to check what works are carried out during closures. “We have also been receiving complaints of water theft during maintenance of valves. The top officials in civic administration need to conduct an audit to avoid water thefts and losses,” she said.

Mahesh Hande of NCP said that the civic administration must introduce better techniques for maintenance and repairs to avoid daylong water cuts. “The water distribution system in the city is weak and needs an overhaul. A complete closure of water often leads to break down of valves and restricts the flow of water due to air bubbles. Eventually, water supply gets affected for the next few days,” Hande added.

Besides the three political parties, BJP MLA Chandrakant Patil had raised objections about the Thursday water cuts and asked the authorities to explain its necessity at a recent canal committee meeting.

290,['8/01/2020'],"R-Power defaults, lenders face insolvency deadline","This story is from January 8, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Reliance Power on Tuesday informed the stock exchanges that it has defaulted on a debt of Rs 685 crore. The company said that the default pertained to the quarter ended December 2019.

On July 6, 2019, all the main lenders of Reliance Power had signed an inter-creditor agreement (ICA). Based on the ICA, lenders had agreed to a six-month standstill, during which they would not initiate recovery of their loans. The objective of the standstill agreement was to implement a resolution plan during the same period.

Reliance Power's default has coincided with the expiry of the 210-day deadline set by the RBI for resolving all stressed loans through an inter-creditor agreement allowed under the central bank's June 6, 2019 circular.

In terms of the circular, if banks failed to arrive at a resolution by January 7, they would have to either initiate insolvency proceedings or set aside as additional provisions, 20% of the stressed loan.

Lenders, through Indian Banks Association, have sought more time from the RBI to complete resolutions of some stressed loans, including loans to the power sector. They have said that their efforts would go waste if they are forced to abandon the resolution discussions and initiate insolvency proceedings because of the deadline expiry. In July 2019, rating agency ICRA had downgraded the company from 'C' with a tag 'issuer non-cooperating' to 'D' on confirmation of delays in debt servicing.

""The liquidity profile of the company, along with its subsidiaries, continues to remain stretched as evident from the considerable decline in the net cash accruals in FY19 and net-worth erosion due to significant impairment of assets,"" ICRA had said.

R-Power, a part of the Reliance Group promoted by Anil Ambani , is the primary vehicle for investments in the power generation sector. The company's generation capacity stood at 5,945 MW, including 5,760 MW of thermal capacity and 185 MW of renewable energy-based capacity.

Its operational projects include Rosa Project at Shahajahnapur, Uttar Pradesh (1,200 MW); Butibori Project at Nagpur, Maharashtra (600 MW), UMPP at Sasan (3,960 MW); solar PV Project at Dhursar, Rajasthan (40 MW), concentrated solar power project at Pokhran, Rajasthan (100 MW) and wind project at Vashpet, Maharashtra (45 MW).

Representative image

PUNE: Teachers assessing the answer sheets of SSC and HSC board examinations have demanded a rise in per paper remuneration.

The teachers said they were being paid around Rs5 for evaluating each paper in comparison to Rs 12 per paper being paid to their CBSE counterparts. There had been no rise in remuneration for the last seven years, they said, adding that the hike would help in accurate and quality assessment.

The Shikshak Hitkarni Sanghatna, an association of junior college teachers, on Monday submitted a letter to the commissioner of state education department Vishal Solanki in this regard, requesteding immediate action.

Prakash Pawar, a member of the association, said, “The state board takes examination fees from every SSC and HSC student. They have also been increasing the exam fees from time to time. But, for the past seven years, the remuneration paid per paper to the teachers has been less.”

Pawar said the teachers’ associations across the state had been urging the government as well as the state board to increase the fees, but to no avail. “These two exams are a turning point in the students’ careers. One mark here and there would make a huge difference. So, it is important that the teachers are given attractive remuneration per paper to ensure accuracy,” he said.

Citing the example of experts assessing the papers of the UPSC examination, Pawar said they were provided air fare to travel to Delhi for the assessment work. “One assessor is given 10 papers at a time and the arrangements for conducting the assessment work is top class just to ensure that the quality of work is not compromised. We are not demanding for the same treatment as UPSC assessors. We are saying that our work should be given justice by paying us well,” he said.

Ashok Bhosale, the secretary of the state board, said, “Whenever we increase the exam fee, we make sure that the remuneration of the teachers is also increased. The last hike was given in 2017, so the claims of no rise in remuneration for the last seven years are baseless.”

Bareilly: The much-needed respite that the sunny days had brought from the cold weather conditions was short-lived, with the afternoon showers on Tuesday lashing the city and bringing the chill back.

The maximum temperature was recorded at 17.6 degrees Celsius and the minimum remained at 11.5 degrees.

The Indian Meteorological Departmental (IMD) has, meanwhile, predicted rain and thundershowers with gusty winds in Western UP districts, including Bareilly, Moradabad, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Hapur, among others, in the next 24 hours. There was not much fog on Tuesday, but IMD has forecast foggy and misty weather conditions in the coming days in the city.

Though it didn’t make much difference in the minimum and maximum temperatures, the 1.4 mm rainfall revived the chilly weather conditions that lasted throughout day.

According to IMD, the minimum temperature was recorded at 11.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, while the maximum remained at 17.6 degrees, three notches below normal. The humidity level was high and recorded at 93% while the minimum humidity remained at 80%.

Showers were also witnessed in neighbouring districts , including Rampur and Moradabad, while cloudy conditions persisted in Shahjahanpur and adjacent areas.

In Moradabad, the maximum was recorded at 20 degrees Celsius and the minimum remained at 10 degrees, whereas Shahjahanpur recorded a minimum of 11.5 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the maximum was 17.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal.

The IMD has predicted that many places in the state will witness cloudy weather conditions that will convert into scattered rainfall in the next couple of days, resulting in a dip in both maximum and minimum temperatures.

Speaking to TOI, head of geography department, Bareilly College, Neeru Agarwal said, “Western disturbances and fresh snowfall in the Himalayan region have revived the cold conditions, which will continue for some time. The mercury will fall in the coming days as the state will be in the grip of cold wave. There is a possibility of another round of winter rains in coming days.”

The moderate rainfall in the city, however, did not hamper day-to-day activities and schools also remained opened. The showers, however, made roads in Choupla, Ayub Khan and Shyamganj-satellite area slushy due to the on-going construction work.

Ruksar Mirza, a local student, said, “Though there was no fog in the morning, there was significant chill in the air since afternoon soon after it rained. Later in the evening, visibility was okay but the climate was misty. There was some relief from biting cold last week, but it seems that the cold conditions are back.”

Kannur: The diesel locomotive of 16308 Kannur-Alappuzha executive express, which derailed while shunting near Kannur railway station in 2016, has turned into scrap.

The loco engine, which is more than 25 years old, was not worthy of rehabilitation following the accident and hence it was decided to sell it as scrap, said the officials. The dismantling process has already began inside the railway station compound.

Though the old engines are sometimes sold to countries like South Africa for loco purpose only, this diesel engine, with 2200 HP power and 4,000 litre fuel capacity, was totally damaged after the accident, according to the inspection conducted by the engineers, said railway officials.

The accident happened at 4:30am on July 5, 2016, when the train was being shunted. The locomotive pilot lost control owing to poor visibility due to rain and it skid off the track and fell into a gorge breaking the concrete wall near Chettiarkulam near the railway station.

A Chennai-based company had bought the engine during an auction conducted by the deputy chief materials manager of Golden Rock Railway Workshop, Tamil Nadu, one of the workshops of Southern Railway zone. The scrap fetched Rs 20,77,000, an official said adding that today it would cost around Rs 8 core to manufacture such an engine.

The auction was held on December 6 last year and the bidder was confirmed on December 24. The dismantling process which began on January 3 is expected to be completed by January 14, said officials.

Though condemned engines are usually dismantled in the loco shed, here it was decided otherwise considering the complexities involved in its transportation from Kannur to Palakkad, said officials.

The incident occurred between NIBM Chowk and Undri when a 19 year-old woman and her husband were on their way home after attending a New Year party on M G Road in Camp. The woman was riding pillion.

“The woman in her complaint said that while they were riding on a stretch along the NIBM Chowk in Kondhwa, a car coming from behind started to chase their motorcycle. The woman alleged that one of the person inside the car tried to inappropriately touch her,” an officer from the Kondhwa police said.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan

BHOPAL: BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan sparked controversy on Tuesday by alleging that 10 Janpath — the residence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi — is the “centre of violence and arson in the country”. Congress reacted by saying that Chouhan has been sidelined in BJP and is trying to be in news by making bizarre statements.

“Congress has been involved in the biggest mob lynching. After the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, Congress pushed the entire country into violence by saying that ‘when a big tree falls, the earth shakes’. Questions are still being raised on Congress’s involvement in mob lynching. Now, the party is trying to push the country into a spiral of violence in the name of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and 10 Janpath is its centre,” Chouhan told mediapersons in Ludhiana.

Chouhan, Madhya Pradesh’s CM for three terms, had triggered a major controversy in August last year when he called former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a “criminal”. Chouhan had attacked Sonia Gandhi recently, asking why she did not say a word in Parliament during the debate on Citizenship Amendment Bill, but staged protests after it became a law.

Justifying the implementation of CAA, Chouhan said that during Partition, Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities living in Pakistan had suffered severe torture. “Punjab suffered the most. Minorities in Pakistan are still suffering torture and people are not safe. They are living in fear,” said Chouhan.

“The incident of stone pelting in Nankana Sahab is unfortunate. Congress is misleading the public to instigate violence. I want to ask Sonia ji, Punjab CM Amrinder Singh ji and MP CM Kamal Nath ji, what is wrong with CAA? What are they opposing? They should come clear on whether they do not want Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities, who have lost their lives in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, to be given Indian citizenship? They should make it clear if they want these Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis to be sent back to Pakistan to die,” said Chouhan.

The BJP leader questioned Congress’s “silence” on the attack on the Nankana Sahab gurdwara in Pakistan. “I want to ask why Sonia ji and Rahul ji took 15 hours to condemn the attack on Nankana Sahab? Leaders from Punjab, who talk loud, did not react on the attack. Is their friendship with Imran so strong that they do not think of their own country? This is Congress character and I condemn this,” said Chouhan.

The former CM accused Rahul and Priyanka of creating misconception in the country on CAA. “But we will not let them succeed. Our leaders, including Prime Minister Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah and acting president JP Nadda are touring the country to make people aware of citizenship law,” he said.

The Congress reacted strongly to Chouhan’s allegation. “Chouhan has turned irrelevant since he lost power. He has been sidelined in his own party and wants to remain in news through bizarre statements,” said Congress state media coordinator Narendra Singh Saluja. “Chouhan has been shunted out of active politics. He should clarify who was held with bombs and explosives. He should also identify who were charged with anti-national activities for being involved in explosions.”

Pilibhit: A 29-year-old woman’s body bearing multiple injuries was found in her house at Mohammadpur village under Bilsanda police station. Police suspect that she was severely beaten up.

The deceased, identified as Renu Devi, was married 11 years ago to Shridhar Tiwari of Mohammadpur village. The couple had three daughters and two sons.

According to her brother, Jagat Narayan, of Chausara village under Bisalpur Kotwali police station, Tiwari and his family members had been harassing Renu for dowry. She was often beaten up, he alleged. The beatings continued despite intervention by the elderly.

KOCHI: Corporations and municipalities are bound by law to abate nuisance from an unattended or unmaintained property within its limits and to recover the expense for the same from the land owner, said the high court .

The decision by Justice Devan Ramachandran came on a petition filed by S Rema of Popular Road in Vaduthala through advocate S Nikhil Sankar. A mini forest has grown in an unattended property next to her house and it has creepers, dense vegetation and uncontrolled undergrowth, making it the abode of reptiles and snakes, thereby causing danger to her and other residents, she had complained in the petition.

Advocate P K Soyuz, who represented Kochi corporation, submitted that action has been taken to clear the ‘mini forest’ as soon as the petition was filed before the HC and he produced photographs of the works done.

Referring to the Kerala Municipality Act, 1994 (sections 426, 427, and 430), the court said in the judgment, “It is without doubt that it is statutorily enjoined upon the secretary of the municipal corporation , under the provisions of the afore extracted Sections of the Act, to ensure that the properties within its territory are maintained without filth and noxious or wild vegetation.”

The judgment stated further, “The conjoined reading of the aforementioned provisions renders it perspicuous that when a citizen approaches the secretary of the corporation with a complaint - that an unattended and unmaintained property is causing nuisance as specified under Section 426 or is covered by filth or noxious or wild vegetation as specified in Section 427 of the Act - then, in my firm view, the said authority becomes obligated in law to take swift action against the owner or occupier of such premises and complete it under the mandate of Section 430 of the Act.” When any building or land becomes a nuisance due to abandonment, the secretary of a corporation or municipality issue notice to the owner to secure, enclose, clear or cleanse the property within a stipulated time, as per section 426.

The secretary of a corporation or a municipality can also issue a notice to the owner of any building or land to remove filth or noxious or wild vegetation within a period of 24 to 48 hours, stipulates section 427.

If the owner of a building or land fails to act despite receiving a notice from the corporation or municipality, the secretary can get the work done and recover the expenses from the owner, says section 430.

Tiger

Bhopal: Almost two years after a tiger ‘couple’ was translocated to Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary in Damoh, two healthy cubs were photographed following their mother, for the first time — sending cheer all around. As per forest officials, there are three cubs, but the third is behind the mother and cannot be seen in the picture.

It is believed that the tigress gave birth sometime in June or July last year, but kept the cubs hidden.

The news is a cause for celebration as before this, tigers have not been sighted in Nauradehi for many years.

“This is very good news. After the success story of tiger reintroduction in neighbouring Panna, now Nauradehi is heading in the same direction,” said divisional forest officer (DFO), Nauradehi, Naveen Garg.

In April 2018, Kanha National Park’s Radha and Bandhavgarh’s Kishen were brought to Nauradehi. Initially, the two were kept in separate enclosures adjacent to each other and released in the wild shortly after.

Like other collared tigers, Radha and Kishen were later coded N1 and N2 respectively by the sanctuary staff.

Radha was an orphan and was raised in an enclosure in Kanha for two years and three months before being relocated with a mate to Nauradehi — spread over 900 square km in Sagar, Damoh and Narsinghpur districts of the state.

According to the latest tiger census, at 526, Madhya Pradesh has the maximum number of tigers in the entire country.

Panaji: The state government has successfully digitised marriage records from 1914 to 2010 — covering almost a century. Basically marriage records since 1914, when the Portuguese enforced the common civil code in the state, can be accessed online.

If a citizen wants to search the record of his/her marriage registered in the state, he or she may access it by visiting www.goaonline.gov.in and registering themselves to avail the service, which was launched by chief minister Pramod Sawant along with law minister Nilesh Cabral on Tuesday.

With the new system becoming functional, citizens won’t have to visit a taluka registrar’s office to search for marriage records between 1914 and 2010. People can visit the website, search, view and download a non-certified marriage record. Cabral said for now people will still have to visit a taluka registrar office to get certified copies, but shortly marriage certificates will be available online.

Within two to three months, people will able to register their marriages online, the law minister said. People won’t have to visit the registrar’s office for marriage or marriage certificate , he said.

To a query that some people face problem in obtaining certificates of marriages registered 50 years ago, the minister said his department is committed to resolve the problem and the process of reconstruction of marriage certificates will start within the next few months.

The chief minister termed the latest service by the state registrar office as “historic” in the country.

“It is a big achievement for Goa to make marriage records of the Portuguese-era online,” Sawant said.

Cabral said credit must be given to the chief minister who intervened to sort out the matter with Prithvi Services Pvt Ltd, which was appointed, in 2010, for digitising the documents. The dispute with the agency was resolved amicably, he said.

About 8,60,000 documents have been scanned and uploaded. The marriage documents from 2010 to 2019 will also be made available online in coming months, he said.

On an average, 12,000 marriages are registered in the state. The new facility has been launched in association with Goa Electronic Ltd, under e-District mission mode project.

Cabral said the state registrar’s office has become over 99% corruption-free.

Kailash Vijayvargiya

BHOPAL: The Congress vs Vijayvargiya war rages on, with the party on Tuesday accusing the BJP national general secretary of involvement in a series of scams, including Simhastha scam and pension scam.

State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja released the list of scams and reeled out some names, asking Vijayvargiya if they were “nationalists or members of mafia groups”.

“Kailash Vijayvargiya should say who is Yuvaraj Ustad. Whose supporter is this man and who is the leader with whom he appears in hoardings and posters? Is he a nationalist or mafia? Who is Hemant Yadav? Who is Munna Doctor?” Saluja asked.

The Congress spokesman, who hails from Indore — the same city as Vijayvargiya — said, “Tai (former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan ) and several BJP leaders have told the party’s top leadership who is the patron of mafia. The list of mafia goons is long, but let Kailash Vijayvargiya identify these persons first.”

Saluja also released a list of scams and accused the BJP leader’s involvement in them. “These scams and financial irregularities occurred during your tenure. Who is involved in them?” he asked. The list includes the pension scam, which allegedly happened during Vijayvargiya’s tenure as mayor of Indore, ‘Simhastha scam’ of 2004 when the BJP general secretary was minister for energy and PWD, the ‘Navratan garden scam’, ‘pipes scam, tubewell boring scam, plastic plant scam and drip scam’.

“The list of scams is a long one, but let Kailash Vijayvargiya reply to these. Let him explain when these scams occurred, in whose tenure and who is responsible for them. And where should those responsible be sent — to jail or on a pilgrimage?” Saluja asked.

TOI tried contacting Vijayvargiya, but he was not available for comment. BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal said, “Kailash Vijayvargiya’s point has been that whatever action is taken by the government should be according to rules and laws and with transparency. Whether Vijayvargiya has been involved in any scam or patronized mafia will be decided as per rules, laws and with transparency. It cannot be decided in the state Congress office.”

BJP argued that a year has passed since Congress came to power in Madhya Pradesh, yet it has found nothing to pin down Vijayvargiya. “Instead of making baseless allegations against Vijayvargiya, Congress should concentrate on implementation of promises it made to the people. They should stop this politics of accusations and start proving their worth in governance,” Agarwal added.

BENGALURU: Contrary to the perception that lakes across the city are cesspools, a study by CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has certified that water quality in 18 (40%) of the 45 lakes it examined is “good”, implying it can be used for domestic and irrigation purposes. However, it’s not fit for drinking.BBMP had commissioned Neeri to assess water quality index (WQI) of all its 206 lakes on directions of the high court, which is hearing a batch of petitions on the condition of various Bengaluru water bodies. In its interim report released recently, the institute said it assessed 45 lakes and quantified their WQI under five classifications: excellent, good , poor, very poor and unsuitable for drinking.According to the study, excellent category means the water is fit for drinking, irrigation and industrial purposes, while good water is fit for domestic, irrigation and industrial uses. Water of poor quality can be used only for irrigation, very poor for ‘restricted’ irrigation and that which is unsuitable for drinking needs proper treatment.The interim report puts the WQI of 22 lakes at poor and two at very poor. Three lakes had no water from August to December last year. The three, incidentally, are yet to be developed, while the remaining 42 have been revived. Also, water in none of the lakes was found to be excellent and fit for drinking.“On HC directions, we engaged Neeri to conduct a comprehensive study of Bengaluru lakes . It has submitted the interim report. We will examine it and augment efforts in improving WQI in all lakes, both which have been developed or have to be developed by BBMP,” said Ravikumar Surpur, special commissioner, major projects and health.Incidentally, the Palike has fully developed only 75 of the 206 lakes it its custody. Sources said shortage of funds is the primary reason for poor maintenance.Asked why water quality of many lakes is certified as poor, a senior BBMP official said: “Lakes in outer areas have not seen development for the past few years. With sewage not being diverted, they continue to receive filth.”Citing the example of Parappana Agrahara lake whose water has been classified as very poor by Neeri, the senior official said it’s because the STP which treats water released from the nearby Central Jail has stopped functioning. “We have issued a notice to jail authorities asking them to fix it. The quality of water will improve within a few months once the STP starts working. Thirumenahalli Lake, which also has very poor water quality as per the study, doesn’t have a proper outlet to release accumulated sewage. We are working on it.”Asked about the green colour of water in most lakes, the official said, “That is not a reflection of the water quality. Soil and sediments of a lake play a vital role in determining the colour.” He added: “Frequent rejuvenation, good rain and STPs can contribute to clearer water,” he added.Making it clear that water termed good is not potable, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said, “It is used only for domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes.”Lake expert Ramprasad said the perception of city lakes will change now.A senior Neeri official said they’ve surveyed all 206 lakes under BBMP and the final report will be submitted soon.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73147543,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/water-quality-is-good-in-18-of-45-bengaluru-lakes-study/articleshow/73145715.cms

Hyderabad: Like everybody else, Raghu Arikapudi goes through newspapers every morning, intently reading stories about accidents, health disorders and the likes. However, he does not stop after a read through. Raghu then makes clippings and sets about on his way to stitch back lives of victims who are undergoing difficulties.

For over two decades, Raghu has been helping people in need, most of them are differently-abled. “The struggles of real people are unimaginable. Can you understand what it means to take three hours to cross a room?” he asks when speaking of a family in which four people suffer from muscular atrophy.

“I read about them in the paper and tracked this family down to Nizampet. The small room in which the family sat was dark and leaking. There were three sisters, all survivors of muscular atrophy. One of their adult sons also suffers from the disorder. The only girl in the family Bhagyalaxmi is unmarried and cannot work as she has to fend for the rest,” said Raghu. Since he met the family, Raghu has helped them out with their rations, medical costs and other expenses. Now, he has taken it on himself to get the Bhagyalaxmi married. “This year for sure,” he says.

In another case, Ravi Kiran and his two brothers suffer from the same disorder and their 80-year-old mother takes care of them. “Their situation will never change, but we can hope to reduce their struggle and make them as independent as possible,” Raghu says. From a middle-income family himself, Raghu works at Bharat Dynamics Limited’s (BDL) assembling section. The time he gets away from his job is spent travelling to be in service of others. He says his wife and kids hardly find him at home but are supportive of his efforts and even help out when they can.

“Helping hands are more powerful than praying lips,” Raghu says reiterating his idol, Mother Teresa’s words. He helps around 30 families with his limited means and is also helped by his BDL employees. “I, as well as other volunteers, regularly follow-up every single case,” he says. For him, the people he helps are not charity cases, they are a lifelong commitment.

Among many who Raghu has been helping is 10-year-old Madhukumar. His family had lost hope when one fateful day, while playing, Madhukumar came in contact with an iron rod connected to an electric line. He received a severe electric shock and lost his limbs.“We are trying to teach him how to use a brush and paint. The idea is to make him independent,” Raghu says.

Dreaming big for the child, Raghu says he eventually plans to get him robotic limbs like ones seen on TV. “Nothing is out of question,” Raghu says with a smile.

MUMBAI: In their first interaction with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, leading industrialists based in Maharashtra raised issues such as the long list of permissions required to set up a company, delay in permissions, high land cost and government taxation while seeking discounts on power tariffs and setting up of new industrial townships and special economic zones.

Thackeray promised them the government would ensure that permissions are fast-tracked.

He also assured them of a conducive business climate so that not a single industry leaves for another state.

Some industrialists said the government should look at expanding the scope of dairy business in the state. Issues regarding pending infrastructure projects, too, were raised. The meeting with prominent business barons was held at the Sahyadari guesthouse in Malabar Hill. Held to gather inputs for formulating a new industrial policy, it lasted two hours. Industries minister Subhash Desai said the government has taken note of issues raised and discussions will be held at the administrative level to resolve them.

Desai said the state plans to host a Magnetic Maharashtra event in Mumbai in November 2020, for which it plans to invite global companies to invest in the state.

HYDERABAD: Setting a blistering pace of growth in office transactions thanks to the soaring demand from the IT/ITeS sector, Hyderabad overtook India’s Silicon Valley, Bengaluru, to emerge as the city with the highest office space transactions in the country for the second half of 2019, according to global real estate consultancy firm Knight Frank .While Hyderabad clocked 8.9 million sq ft of office transactions in the July-December 2019 period, Bengaluru could record only 7 msft office transactions in the same period. In H2 2018, Bengaluru was ahead in the office market with 6.9 msft transactions vis a vis Hyderabad’s 4.3 msft. Mumbai clocked the third highest office transactions during H2 2019 at 5.1 msft but recorded flat growth as compared to the corresponding period of 2018.The IT/ITeS sector accounted for a chunk of the total office transactions in Hyderabad at 58% in H2 2019, up from 44% in H2 2018. Co-working players, on the other hand, accounted for 1.36 msft or 15% of the total office space transacted in Hyderabad, Knight Frank said in its latest report ‘India Real Estate: H2 2019’ that compared the performance of eight cities.The year 2019 also saw Hyderabad record an all-time high of 12.8 msft in terms of office transaction volumes, an 82% jump over the 7 msft figure it clocked in 2018. However, despite its record breaking performance, the city emerged second in office transactions for 2019 after Bengaluru, which topped the charts with 15.3 msft transactions in 2019 vis a vis 13.4 million in 2018. Mumbai came third here too with 9.7 msft office transactions during the full year as compared to 7.9 msft in 2018.Knight Frank pointed out that infrastructure constraints in Bengaluru are prompting IT/ITeS occupiers to consider Hyderabad for their expansion plans. Adding to Hyderabad’s attractiveness quotient is the availability of a rich and diverse talent pool thanks to the presence of premier educational institutions.“Hyderabad’s remarkable surge brings it at par with other major markets.... Primarily driven by organic growth of technology and ITeS companies, this demand is expected to remain stable in the near future. Increased activity in the co-working segment is further supplementing the city’s growth momentum,” Samson Arthur, branch director-Hyderabad, Knight Frank India, said while releasing the report.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73153320,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227187,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-tops-charts-in-countrys-office-space-market-in-h2-19/articleshow/73145549.cms

Prakash Ambedkar

MUMBAI: Addressing an anti-CAA, NPR and NRC meeting of clerics and imams on Tuesday, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi ( VBA ) chief and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar said the best way to oppose the “black law” is not to cooperate with the authorities when they come to verify citizenship.

At a meeting called by senior cleric Maulana Moin Ashraf Quadri (Moin Mian) at his Grant Road-based madrassa, Ambedkar slammed the Centre for framing a law that he alleged is not just against Muslims but against nomadic tribes, Dalits and OBCs too.

“CAA and NRC are part of RSS’s plan to impose their exclusivist, Vedic cultural nationalism which is against the inclusive, syncretic culture of India as established by Mahatma Phule and other saints and Sufis. We will have to fight a sustained battle,” he said. “Don’t show the papers when they come asking for them. The government already has enough documents to prove that we have been living here for centuries.” CAA and NRC are against the poor who cannot show documents, said Ambedkar. “Either you fight and get the law repealed or go to detention camps,” Ambedkar added.

Hyderabad: A 31-year-old advocate has been going around the city asking locals if they had spotted his elder sister. On December 25, Kuthuru Parikshith’s elder sister, 34-year-old Rohitha left her rented accommodation in Gachibowli and her cellphone behind and has not returned home since.

“It has been 12 days (on Tuesday) since she went missing. She was spotted in Secunderabad recently. I gave police a lookout notice so that they can paste it at every possible public place, however, I still have not gotten any confirmation if this has been done. Initially police told me that she might have gone to a New Year’s party just days after I filed a missing complaint. I was shocked (by police’s response). Why would anyone go to a party without their phone?” Parikshith said.

Meanwhile, police suspect that Rohitha is going around wilfully. “We were initially fearing, that she was kidnapped. As she left her cellphone at home, tracing her has become difficult,” said Gachibowli inspector R Srinivas. He added that cops in Secunderabad were alerted and nine teams were formed to trace her.

Since the past week, the advocate and his friends have been going around the city in search and scouring social media for leads. “The police should be doing all this. Instead, I am giving them leads. On Saturday, I got word that my sister was seen around Patny circle. I asked around and few people told me that she had been seen around Secunderabad station. But since then even police has no further information,” the advocate said.

Hyderabad: In the ongoing multi-crore Insurance Medical Services (IMS) scam, ACB sleuths stumbled upon more leads involving Legend Enterprises which operated out of a fake address and furnished different addresses to different government agencies. “In one of the (three) addresses mentioned, Legend Enterprises had an office but other than a refrigerator and a table, there was nothing. There was not even a board mentioning that it’s an office space. This clearly indicated that it was a shell firm ,” said an ACB investigator.

In three different letters submitted to government agencies, including Drugs Control Authority (DCA), commercial tax department and IMS between 2013 and 2015, the Legend Enterprises office door number was mentioned differently. “When our investigators tried to visit the three addresses in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar of Kukatpally, they found that one address did not even exist. In the second address, a private individual, Siraj, was staying and the place has got nothing to do with Legend Enterprises,” the investigator said.

According to ACB officials, Legend Enterprises was established in 2013 with Krupasagar Reddy as a proprietor. ACB officials allege that Omni Medi’s proprietor K Srihari Babu, one of the accused in the scam, was the brain behind the establishment of Legend Enterprises with Krupasagar as its proprietor.

The sleuths said Srihari was in collusion with IMS officials and Krupasagar and resorted to multi-crore fraud by purchasing medical kits at a higher price.

According to ACB officials, Rs 54 crore was transferred from the SBI Balkampet account of Legend Enterprises to Omni Medi bank account between April and December 2017. So far, ACB has registered seven cases and arrested 23 persons.

Hyderabad: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been file in the Telangana high court against businessman Sukesh Kumar and his companies alleging that they had cheated public sector units and banks to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore. The petition was filed by BJYM worker and activist Arun Kumar Goshamallu against the businessman and his companies MBS Impex, MBS Jewellers, Aashish Realtors and others. Sukesh Gupta denied the allegations saying they had been made with vested interests.

“CBI and ED investigated into MMTC gold purchase fraud by Sukesh Gupta’s companies. But there are several loose ends. CBI, ED and CVC are not responding to my fresh complaints. No FIR has been registered regarding loans granted by Andhra Bank and approved accorded by the bank for assignment of debts of Sukesh Gupta and his companies to Asset Reconstruction Company,” Arun Kumar said.

“The CVC has ordered declaration of MBS Jewellers’ and MBS Impex’s bank accounts as fraud since directors had been declared wilful defaulters by various banks. In 2014, Anurag Gupta had been accused of hawala transactions worth Rs 8 crore. The alleged links of Sukesh Gupta to Dubai and Hong Kong-based companies need to be checked,” the petitioner said and alleged foul play with regards to a property in King Koti.

Responding to the allegations, Sukesh Gupta told TOI: “People with vested interests are digging up old cases. The MMTC case with CBI and ED are pertaining to derivative laws. We have not done committed any fraud. The issues are about forex loss where the rupee depreciated during the course of a business transaction. I have also settled the issue with MMTC.

Hyderabad: Family members of the veterinarian who was raped and murdered in Hyderabad last year, welcomed the death warrants served to four convicts in the Nirbhaya case, but have called for a speedier justice system. Shortly after a Delhi court on Tuesday issued death warrants to the convicts, the father of 27-year-old Disha said the judiciary system needs to improve.

“The verdict is no doubt satisfying for the whole country, but the family of the girl had to wait for seven long years for justice. The judiciary system needs to improve. In such gruesome cases, the judgment should be given within six months, so that family does not suffer the pain for years,” said Disha’s father on Tuesday.

Reacting to the verdict, the sister of the government veterinary doctor said that seven years is a long time. “Seven years is not a short span for a grieving family. They must have gone through pain and trauma while they waited for the verdict. But I am happy that the accused were given a death sentence,” said the sister.

On November 27 last year, the government veterinary doctor was gang-raped and burnt to death by four truck drivers at an underpass in Shadnagar. The incident took place a stone’s throw away from the city’s outer ring road and close to a toll plaza. Days after the four accused were arrested, they were killed in an encounter by the Cyberabad police on December 6 near the scene of the crime.

The vigil at St Joseph’s College of Commerce

BENGALURU: City students continued to decry Sunday’s violence on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus. Interestingly, in a deviation from the earlier protests witnessed in Bengaluru, Tuesday saw a candlelight vigil inside the campus of a private institution: St Joseph’s College of Commerce on Brigade Road.

While hundreds of St Joseph’s students dressed in black gathered in the morning to mark their protest against the JNU attack , a candlelight vigil in the evening saw the participation of other college students as well. “I always wanted to be a part of the protests in the city. However, safety was always a concern. Due to the safety net provided by St Joseph’s College, I didn’t want to miss the chance,” said Dadi Christopher, a BCom student.

The vigil was against the rampant violence against students across the country. “There are students who support the Citizenship (amendment) Act and those who don’t. But we have all come together because the government is trying to suppress dissent. That is a sign of fascism. We have the constitutional right to dissent and doing so doesn’t make us anti-national,” said Mohammed Maqdoom, a BBA final-year student.

Though others wanted to join the event, the organisers ensured it was only for students. “As my own institution didn’t organise such an event, I thought I must extend support to my peers who are socially and politically aware and believe in constructive nation-building,” said Shruti Lal, student of St Joseph’s (autonomous).

Students from institutions like Kristu Jayanthi, St Joseph’s Evening College and Jain University participated in the vigil. Yashik Ravi, student of Jain College, Jayanagar, said: “There’s no point in cribbing about things unless you do something about it. This was a great platform to show our dissent.”

Indian Institute of Science (IISc) students also conducted a protest march on Monday night. The institution also held a talk on CAA. A 24-hour student protest began at 6pm at Maurya Junction, Race Course Road.

‘Violence unacceptable’

Students and youth are the present and future of any democracy. It is imperative that our voices be heard and our opinions respected by any state that wishes to progress as a democracy. The (JNU) situation is a violation of basic principles of a humane democracy. The violence faced by students and teachers on their own campus is unacceptable

319,['8/01/2020'],TenderSURE work puts Margosa Rd users on unsure footing,"Clumps of mud and dug-up stretches make driving an arduous task on Malleswaram’s Margosa Road

TimesView Be it TenderSURE roads, whitetopping, expansion of the Metro corridor or laying of pipelines, infrastructure projects in Bengaluru are perennially a work in progress. Civic agencies have a barrage of excuses up their sleeve — sometimes rain throws cold water on their plans and often, lack of coordination/funds is to blame. In the case of Margosa Road, the delay has been attributed to lack of space. While some disruption is a given during execution of a civic project, prolonged delays are not acceptable. BBMP should pull up its socks so that frequent users of the road are spared further misery.

BENGALURU: The snail’s pace of TenderSURE work on Margosa Road , the lifeline linking northwest Bengaluru to central and southern parts of the city, is unleashing chaos on the roads of Malleswaram . This is exasperating residents, motorists, shopkeepers and people frequenting hospitals.Several stretches of the road are paved with gravel with no topping. Clumps of mud on the street make riding and driving arduous tasks. The pavements demand some tightrope walking.The work began in January 2019 and was slated to end in December. While the deadline has expired, BBMP officials say only a 300-metre sidewalk on one side from Maramma Temple Circle to 18th Cross may be ready in another two weeks. Though they asserted the project will be completed by March, it seems highly unlikely as work has been taken up only on one side of the pavement along the entire road length.BBMP officials blamed the delay on lack of sufficient space to execute the project and also the widespread roots of trees on either side of the road.“We are trying to expedite the work and have nearly 40 labourers at any given point of time. Tree roots and underground pipeline work are slowing it down,” an official said, adding that any effort to take up more space only ends up further choking the road.The 1.6km-long Margosa Road cutting through Malleswaram links Maramma Circle Temple to Mahakavi Kuvempu Road and is widely used by people heading from Yeshwantpur and Rajajinagar to commute to Malleswaram Circle, Seshadripuram, Majestic, City Market, Chamarajpet and other areas.The road is lined with residential plots as well as commercial establishments including hospitals, educational institutions and eateries among others. Some of the city’s oldest and prestigious educational institutions too are stone’s throw away. The road comes under three wards: Malleswaram, Kadu Malleshwara and Rajamahal.Malleswaram corporator Jaypal N said, “I’m aware of the troubles faced by motorists due to the tardy pace of work, which is not only slowing down traffic but also kicking up dust in the air. Since the stretch comes under major roads, I don’t directly have a say but I have apprised the authorities concerned and asked them to speed it up.”“We’ve been dealing with the situation for many days. We have tried to bring it up at ward committee meetings but corporators say since it’s a TenderSURE road they don’t have a say and won’t be able to help us with the deadline,” said Rekha Chari, president, Malleswaram resident welfare association.A manager at Laxmi Maternity Home on Margosa Road said, “Things have become very problematic for patients. Most of them pregnant woman, who have a hard time walking on the gravel. Our security guards have to handhold them.”“Last week, a patient in labour was brought in but the ambulance didn’t have a place to stop. Finally, our nurses had to carry her on the stretcher for some distance because pushing the stretcher on wheels was not an option,” she said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73149366,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-90922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tendersure-work-puts-margosa-rd-users-on-unsure-footing/articleshow/73145886.cms

Milk from six tankers coming from Sehore, Rajgarh and Betul was checked at the main gate of the Sanchi Dugdh Sangh at around 8am. Six samples from these tankers were taken and sent for purity test. The samples were taken after breaking the seal of the tankers that were inspected, said senior food safety officer D K Verma.

The food safety officials also took two samples of milk from the collection and chilling centre of the Sanchi plant at Tara Sevaniya and Mugaliya Haat. Milk is put into tankers at these places for supply in areas around Bhopal city.

322,['8/01/2020'],Ninder farmers begin unique stir to oppose Jaipur Development Authority land grab,"This story is from January 8, 2020

A farmer sits half-buried on land acquired by JDA in Ninder.

JAIPUR: After a gap of nearly two years, farmers of Ninder village near here re-launched zameen samadhi satyagraha (half-bury their bodies in the ground) as a mark of protest against Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) for forcefully acquiring their agriculture land to develop a housing colony.

On Monday, farmers protesting under the banner of Nindar Bachao Sangharsh Samiti again sat half-buried on land acquired by JDA demanding compensation as per the new Land Acquisition Act. They were supported by women in large numbers who did not sit inside the pit, but were present on the spot.

Nagendra Singh, coordinator of Ninder Bacho Sangarsh Samiti said, “Our demands have fallen on deaf ears of JDA officials. We also tried to meet chief minister Ashok Gehlot and urban development and housing minister. The JDA did not adhere to the past agreement and we will continue our protest in a democratic manner till the time our demands are met.”

The farmers claimed that the affected owners were issued award for acquisition on May 31, 2103, whereas the new Land Acquisition Act came into force only on January 1, 2013. The government should have provided compensation as per the new Act, they claimed.

It was further alleged that the JDA failed to adhere to the agreement and started work at the site without paying compensation to farmers.

Sitaram Shrama, another protester said, “Most of the affected farmers have not surrendered the land. However, the JDA claims that the land has been surrendered with the consent of the affected owners. We were jailed for 11 days by the previous government, but we didn’t surrender our lands.”

According to the JDA records, a housing scheme is proposed on 327 hectares. Till date, approximately 204 hectares has been surrendered by farmers, while possession of 123 hectares is yet to be taken by the JDA.

A senior JDA official said, “The process of acquisition of land has already been completed. In such a situation, farmers demand to deacquire the land is unjustified. The affected people had also approached the Supreme Court. However, the petition dismissed on September 4 2018.”

During the BJP government, farmers for the first time started this unusual agitation on October 2, 2018. The farmers sat inside the pits and trenches and buried themselves waist-deep in the mud for 44 days. The state government acquired 1,350 bighas in several stages since 2010 for a housing project despite the land owners’ refusal to accept compensation.

Representative image

JAIPUR: A 35-year-old woman was found murdered at her residential apartment in city’s Pratap Nagar area on Tuesday. Her two-year-old son is missing, which has led cops to believe that the crime was possibly carried out, or at least planned, by a close acquaintance since all valuables — including the jewellery on the victim’s body — were found intact.

Around 5pm, neighbours found blood oozing out of the woman’s living room and entered the apartment to find her lying in a pool of blood. On receiving information, police and forensic experts rushed to the spot to assess the crime scene.

“When we went inside, we found everything in place,” said a senior police officer.

“All the almirahs, safes and even the clothes and jewellery worn by the woman, were intact. She was found with grave head injuries, and might have been hit on the head with a pestle,” said a senior police officer.

The woman’s husband was not at home and arrived after cops intimated him of the murder . “That is when we realized the couple’s two-year-old son was missing,” the officer added.

Based on the crime scene assessment and circumstantial evidence, police prima facie believe the murder was carried out, or at least planned, by a close acquaintance. A senior officer said the possibility of rape has also been ruled out since the victim’s body and clothes were found intact. Police have also found a blood-stained teddy bear. “We have sought CCTV footage of the apartment and nearby locations,” the officer added.

“There was no trespassing, no robbery attempt, which means someone close to the woman must have been behind the crime. In an attempt to mislead the investigation, the child has also been taken away,” police commissioner Anand Srivastav told TOI over the phone.

324,['8/01/2020'],Youth injured in leopard attack in Khed taluka,"This story is from January 8, 2020

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD : An 18-year-old youth was injured in a leopard attack in Vadgaon Patole village in Khed taluka around 2pm on Sunday, prompting the forest department to start night patrolling and public awareness drive in and around the area.

AG Shendge, range forest officer, Khed, told TOI, “The forest department officials are monitoring the movement of leopards in the region since the Sunday attack. One cage has already been installed in Dondi village, adjacent to Vadgaon Patole. Leopards have a long range and move constantly in search of food and water. So, we will decide in a few days whether to shift this cage to the spot where the attacked occurred or install another cage there.”

The attack happened when the youth, Amol Jadhav, was on his way to meet his father, Kaluram, a farm labourer, at Shiroli village — 3km from the attack site. “Amol had walked around 1.5km and was passing through the jowar fields in the Khapardara area of Vadgaon Patole village when a leopard came out of the fields and pounced on him,” Siddharth Kohinkar, a member of the gram panchayat, said.

Amol suffered severe injuries and scratches on his hand in the attack.

“His cries for help frightened the leopard, which fled into the jowar fields,” Kohinkar said.

Villagers later rushed Amol to a nearby private hospital. “The doctors there advised us to take him to a government hospital for vaccination. I then contacted the forest department officials and took him to the nearby rural hospital where he was given preliminary treatment. Later, the forest department officials took him to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-run Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital in Pimpri for vaccination,” he added.

Dondi village is located 3-4km from Khed town. Sugar cane is grown on a large scale in the village, one of the main reasons for the leopards to be found there in large numbers.

When contacted, village sarpanch Swati Kohinkar said, “There is panic among the villagers after Sunday’s leopard attack. We expect the forest department officials to catch the elusive leopard as soon as possible.”

325,['8/01/2020'],"Water board coffers run dry, govt bodies named major defaulters","This story is from January 8, 2020

Secunderabad: The two primary civic departments in the city Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) which cater to the needs of nearly one million citizens, have locked horns over payment of outstanding water dues amounting to nearly Rs 20 crore.

The fund-starved HMWS&SB has been doing the rounds of several civic bodies to recover dues that have been pending for a long time, said sources. According to official records, the Buddha Bhavan, North Zone GHMC circle office, Hari Hara Kala Bhavan and traffic police station near Parade Grounds are major defaulters.

Buddha Bhavan, located on MG Road, is maintained by GHMC for official and commercial purposes. The complex, which is one of the top defaulters among government departments in Secunderabad, has a due of nearly Rs 1.67 crore.

Offices of the director general, Special Protection Force (SPF), executive engineer, Hussainsagar and Telangana State Women’s Commission are housed at Buddha Bhavan.

The ground floor of the 8-storey structure has also been let out by the GHMC to 19 commercial establishments on rent. HMWS&SB supplies water to these establishments on alternate days.

“The water board had stopped supplying water to Buddha Bhavan during the course of last year, after GHMC failed to pay the dues. But later, the supply was restored after top officials from the state government mounted pressure on then GHMC commissioner, Janardhan Reddy. The water board has been regularly serving notices to GHMC to clear the Buddha Bhavan dues,” sources in HMWS&SB told TOI.

The next major defaulter was found to be Hari Hara Kala Bhavan, in Secunderabad. The auditorium, which of one the largest in the twin cities has outstanding dues of Rs 67 lakh. The 30-year-old auditorium that hosts award ceremonies, plays, and film festivals is busy throughout the year. It can seat over 1,400 people and has three water connections.

The zonal office of GHMC at Marredpally was found to have dues amounting to Rs 50 lakh for the past three years. Other GHMC wings such as sports, veterinary, roads, parks and town planning and engineering are located in the same premises.

According to sources at HMWS&SB, the dues have not been cleared despite multiple reminders. GHMC authorities, however, said that they have been ‘adjusting’ the pending amount towards payment of property tax for water board’s assets, such as Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Divisions, spread across the city.

The issue of the payment of outstanding dues can only be resolved after both major departments come to a consensus on matters such as payment of property tax etc, officials said.

The dues can only be cleared if a decision is made by higher authorities on the matter, which can then be followed by both parties, said GHMC sources.

326,['8/01/2020'],"Bareilly, Budaun among three UP districts to report malaria API more than one","This story is from January 8, 2020

Bareilly: An increase in the annual parasite incidence (API), a measure of malaria morbidity for a given year at any given geographical level, in three UP districts of Bareilly , Budaun and Sonbhadra — 8.95, 5.45 and 1.69 respectively — in 2019 against the set government guidelines of one is a matter of concern. Officials are, however, confident that the high API can be controlled by taking various measures.

The API — important for epidemiological surveillance and planning the control strategy for malaria — is calculated by multiplying the total number of positive slides for parasite in a year by 1000 and divided by the total population in a given geographical region (total no. of positive slides for parasite in a year X 1000 / total population).

The health department tested blood samples of a total of 58,54,414 people in 2019 in the state and found 92,732 positive for malaria. Of the total 92,732 malaria cases, Bareilly reported 46,717 cases, Budaun (20,339) and Sonbhadra reported (3,689). Health department officials said both Bareilly and Budaun had reported malaria outbreaks in 2018 and 2019 consecutively, while Sonbhadra was declared malaria endemic-hit a few years ago.

According to officials, the annual blood examination rate for malaria should be 10% of the total population according to the government’s guidelines. And thus, going by the government’s guidelines, the blood samples of around two crore people (in accordance to the state’s population) should have been carried out for 2019 instead of only 58.54 lakh.

Joint director (malaria) Dr Awadhesh Yadav said, “Bareilly, Budaun and Sonbhadra are only three districts in UP where API is more than one. API can be reduced by increasing blood examination rate, proper surveillance, treatment, ensuring malaria patients’ complete (full course) treatment and vector control. We are hopeful of increasing blood examination rate in the current year and will take steps to reduce API in the given three districts.”

Of the total 92,732 cases reported in UP in 2019, 14,457 were of “killer” malaria strain — plasmodium falciparum (PF) — while 78,725 were of milder form of malaria — plasmodium vivax (PV). In Bareilly district, 46,717 cases, including 12,141 PF cases, were detected last year. Budaun, however, reported 18,302 PV cases and 2,037 PF cases in 2019.

According to the health department, in 2018, a total of 86,486 cases — 64,352 PV and 22,134 PF — were reported in UP. “The state, however, saw a decline in PF cases in 2019 as compared to 2018, but an increase in the number of PV cases,” said officials.

Rescue operations underway at Anita Colony in Jaipur on Tuesday.

JAIPUR: Three labourers were killed and three others were injured after a fire broke out at an under-construction building in Anita Colony area near Gandhi Nagar railway station here on Tuesday evening. All the three died of suffocation and did not sustain major burn injuries, a doctor at the Jaipuria Hospital said.

The incident took place at 8.15pm when the six labourers were working in the building where wooden interior work was in progress, police said. Five of the six, who were working on the fifth floor, were trapped inside the building as its doors, woodworked walls and false ceiling caught fire. The sixth, who was on the first floor, managed to come out of the building with minor burn injuries, they added.

A team of senior police officers and three fire tenders rushed to the spot. “We used ropes and other equipment to bring the trapped labourers out of the building while continuing our efforts to douse the fire,” said Devang, assistant fire officer.

By 8.45pm all the five trapped labourers were taken out. “None of them had grave burn injuries and they, along with the sixth, were rushed to the Jaipuria and SMS hospitals. Three of them were unconscious when they were rescued from the building,” said a senior police officer.

At the Jaipuria hospital, the three unconscious labourers — identified as Azhar, Nizam and Saurabh — succumbed.

“None of them had grave burn injuries and prima facie it appears that they died of suffocation as they were unable to have enough oxygen. Also carbon dioxide got into their windpipe, which blocked their respiratory tract,” said a doctor at Jaipuria.

Two other injured labourers were undergoing treatment at SMS hospital. Their condition is said to be critical. The one who had managed to come out on his own, was sent home after first aid.

Fire officials got the nearby buildings evacuated and the fire was doused by 9.15pm.

Police said a case of causing death due to negligence would be registered against the owner of the building.

Chandan Krupadas Shewani

PUNE: The Satara police arrested a Nana Peth-based man, Afridi Rauf Khan (23), in connection with the kidnapping and murder of Chandan Krupadas Shewani of Sadhu Vaswani Chowk and handed him over to the city police late on Monday night for investigations.

A city court remanded Khan in police custody till January 15.

Confirming the arrest of Khan, joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said, “We have also ascertained the identity of three other men involved in the crime. We shall soon arrest them,” he said, adding that Khan was giving misleading answers to the questions posed to him.

A source said the four men behind the abduction and murder of Shewani did not establish contact with each other over the phone after the committing the crimes. Khan was left with no cash and he visited a few houses seeking money to travel to Pune. One of the villagers alerted the Satara police about Kahn’s suspicious movement and then he was arrested.

Shewani, an unmarried man, was found murdered at Padegaon village near Lonand in Satara district on Sunday morning. Police had found a note near his body stating that he was killed because he did not give them Rs2 crore.

The police said the note was kept there to mislead the police probe. “None of the Shewani family members received any extortion calls either on Saturday or on Sunday. Thus, we feel that Shewani was not abducted and murdered for extortion. There might be some other reason,” said a senior police officer.

Shewani owned a footwear shop on Laxmi Road. After closing it late on Saturday night, he was returning home in his car when the unidentified persons kidnapped and murdered him.

Additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said, “Prima facie the motive was extortion, but it was not the main motive. Things will be clear only after the arrest of the other three men in the case. The search for them is on.”

The police are yet to recover Shewani’s cellphone, Shinde added.

BHOPAL: After maintaining in the M P high court for over a year that merger of the Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research (BMHRC) with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhopal, is being considered in the interest of both institutions, the ministry of health and family welfare has handed over the BMHRC 's administration back to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The department of health & research (DHR) had earlier taken charge from the ICMR .

An order issued with the signature of Vinod Kumar, deputy secretary in the government of India, says: “With the approval of competent authority, a high-power committee (HPC) was constituted by the department of health research (DHR) under the chairmanship of secretary, DHR, with members from department of health & family welfare, BMHRC, AIIMS, New Delhi, AIIMS, Bhopal, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum (Kerala) to decide the modalities for smooth functioning of BMHRC, Bhopal. The committee after detailed deliberations finalized and submitted its recommendations to the government. The committee recommended transfer of BMHRC to ICMR as one of its institutes. The recommendation of the HPC for transfer of BMHRC to ICMR was considered in the department and accepted by the competent authority. Accordingly, the administrative control of BMHRC stands transferred from DHR to ICMR”. The order was issued on November 29, 2019.

Rachna Dhingra, co-convener of Bhopal Group of Information & Action, which is one of the petitioners in the PIL regarding medical care of gas victims, while reacting to the fresh order on transfer of BMHRC to ICMR, said: “The HPC was set up to look into the merger of BMHRC with AIIMS and how does it go back to ICMR? Also, in the entire order, there is hardly any mention of gas victims. The entire order is focused on the welfare of the director and employees of BMHRC. That is why orders like these get passed because we have an insensitive and incompetent system, which fails to recognise the problems being suffered by gas victims.”

Member of Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, Purnendu Shukla, said: “The DHR should have informed the committee about transfer of BMHRC back to ICMR. It should also have sought permission of the high court, which is seized of a contempt petition accusing DHR of not complying with the Supreme Court order on BMHRC. We shall bring it to the notice of the court.”

The order doesn’t specify who is the competent authority and considerations on which Vinod Kumar approved the BMHRC's transfer back to ICMR, which had expressed its inability to administer the hospital following which the apex court had transferred the hospital's administration to DHR in 2015. This was the fourth time that BMHRC's administration was transferred from one agency to another.

While the apex court -- in its August 2012 order -- had asked the DHR to develop BMHRC like an autonomous medical education institute so that it could attract competent doctors, the order transferring the hospital's administration to ICMR talks of “exploring the possibility of its affiliation to Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences for award of medical post graduate (MD/MS) and super speciality (DM/MCH ) degrees to medical graduates who join the post graduate and super speciality courses in BMHRC. It would also help BMHRC in capacity building and making it an institute of excellence”, says the order.

The order proposes to retain the present director, BMHRC, and allow her to complete the tenure of five years from the date of her appointment as director, BMHRC, on deputation.

The BMHRC employees will have the option to continue their service under the government of India or work with BMHRC under ICMR. If he/she decides to continue with the government of India, his/her case would be referred to the surplus cell of DoPT for posting in some office/organization under the government of India as per the policy laid down for the purpose.

BJP state minority cell secretary Akram Khan

Bhopal: The state secretary of BJP minority cell in Madhya Pradesh, Akram Khan, resigned from his post over CAA and NRC on Monday, saying he couldn’t bear ‘indecent comments on a class-specific community’.

In his letter to state BJP minority cell president Sanvar Patel, Khan said, “I am resigning from the post due to NRC and CAA. Please accept my resignation.”

Later, talking to reporters, Khan said, “I have been serving the party for 25 years and respect the party’s decision on NRC and CAA. However, BJP colleagues were involved in indecent comments on a class-specific community. This is hurting sentiments. Hence, I have decided to quit.”

The BJP leader said that he had informed senior leaders, including state office-bearers, but no action was taken. “I am a part of BJP and I am here because of the party but, I cannot resist provocative remarks of fellow BJP workers,” he reiterated.

The BJP has denied that party workers were targeting a ‘class specific community’. ""We have instructed all party workers not to incite or create confusion among public on NRC and CAA. Special instructions have been issued not to hurt public sentiments on this issue. We will talk to the leader concerned,” said BJP state spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya.

DEHRADUN: The health department, on Tuesday, put the 108 ambulance service stationed at the state assembly on high alert after a local resident made a complaint regarding an “accident-prone zone” at National Highway 72. The complaint was made at chief minister’s complain portal and the complainant claimed that the accident fatalities at the spot could have been lesser if the ambulance had reached the victims on time.

According to the officials of health department, the 108 ambulance, stationed at state assembly, has been put on high alert and it will be sent to NH 72 (near Mani Mandir, Harrwala) in case of any accident. Earlier, an ambulance from Doiwala (around 8 kilometre from the spot) was sent to attend the cases near Mani Mandir. The ambulance service was sent to attend as many as nine major accident cases in this area in the past eight months.

“The assembly is situated barely four kilometre away from the spot and hence we have put the ambulance there on high alert,” says the press statement issued by the third party agency that manages 108 ambulance service in the state.

Meanwhile, Dr Amita Upreti, director general (health), in a review meeting of chief medical officers of all 13 districts, stressed on ensuring that the machines remain functional in all the hospitals in their respective areas.

“At present, 56 different types of medical tests can be conducted at district hospitals. Soon, this count would be increased to 134. Meanwhile, we are also ensuring that facilities for 97 different types of medical tests are provided at community and primary health centres,” added Dr Upreti.

DURGAPUR: As news reached Durgapur that Delhi Police had filed an FIR against Aishe Ghosh , the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president, her parents remained undaunted back in her home town. Far from being demoralized, Aishe’s mother Sharmistha chose to hit the streets by joining a protest rally against the assault on her daughteron JNU campus.

“I am proud of my daughter. She is a fighter and will continue with her struggle. I demand resignation of the JNU vice-chancellor for the assault. All this is happening under the VC who owes allegiance to the saffron fold. With such a VC on the chair, I am not finding it safe to keep my daughter on the campus any more. It is very difficult for outsiders to enter the campus.

“Whenever I go to meet my daughter, I have to seek permission at four different stages. My daughter has to inform the authorities that her mother will be visiting her on campus. I want to know how could people enter the campus and attack my daughter?” asked Sharmistha.

The march Sharmistha took part in on Tuesday started from Durgapur’s DTPS Colony near the quarters of DVC staff. Many locals and DVC employees joined in the rally. Many students and youth of Durgapur were seen in the protest march.

“A JNU student named Najib remains untraced. For this reason, I am worried about my daughter as I fear she may be harmed as well,” added Aishe’s father Debashish.

The FIR against Aishe and 19 others was registered on a complaint by JNU authorities. It is among three FIRs filed over the violence inside the JNU campus. Delhi Police is yet to arrest anyone on any of the FIRs.

PUNE: Sale of residential units in the second half of 2019 remained tepid and belied the promise the first half of the year had held out, data available with various research agencies revealed.Battered by regulatory changes, liquidity constraints and a general slowdown in economy, the real estate sector had hoped in the first half of 2019 that the worst was behind.The sales data revealed that the sector was not yet out of the woods (see graphic). In fact, the sales were currently at least 30% lower than the highs of 2011 and 2012.“The investors have vanished from the market. Earlier, there were many investors and now the residential sector is more of an end-user market,” said Paramvir Singh Paul, branch director for the Pune region at Knight Frank India.Vivek Rathi, vice-president for research with Knight Frank, said the prices in the sector should remain more or less the same in 2020.The Gera report revealed that the prices were largely constant across the city and even in the broader Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) localities in 2019. He said though sales have increased, considering the broader areas of PMRDA, more needed to be done to stimulate the projects where houses were on hold.“The stimulus fund will not be enough. What is needed is that the buyers should come forward and pitch in a little more money to save what they have already invested. The government can waive the interest in such cases and tell the buyers only to pay back the principal on the top-up,” said Rohit Gera, managing director, Gera Developments.The Gera report estimated that over 40,000 units were in the 242 odd held-up projects and over 16,000 of them have been sold.The first half of 2019 had offered some hope that the industry might be turning around and the effects of demonestisation and GST effect might be wearing off. “While H12019 saw significant housing sales growth, it was the second half (H2 2019) that derailed the growth story in 2019,” said Anuj Puri , chairman, Anarock Property Consultants.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73152241,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-582333,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/real-estate-sector-still-sluggish-agencies-say-investors-vanished/articleshow/73146387.cms
342,['8/01/2020'],Researchers rue lack of ‘clear’ info on official site,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Pune: Information on the state property department’s registration website do not give a clear picture of the realty market transactions despite daily updates, data researchers feel.

The work of update and providing simplified information of sale and purchase of new properties and lease property registrations was proposed almost three years ago, officials in the department said. The update process has been delayed with several other projects lined up in the department, the officials admitted.

For now, the government provides the number of documents registered and taxes collected against them on the site. These are a mishmash of sales of new and second-hand homes, commercial space and land sales and delayed conveyance, among others, making it difficult to understand the market behaviour over a period.

“We are working towards ensuring detailed sale, purchase and lease agreement registration data to help the analysts. We should be able to take it up this year,” an official said.

Another worry is the lack of district-wise numbers on the sale, purchase and lease agreement registrations. The historical data have also been updated only till 2017. Real estate data researcher N Kelshikar said the data available on government website was complex in nature. “The way the data are presented is very technical and difficult to understand. This creates ambiguity in the minds of people,,” he told TOI.

“Lack of official data is a major hindrance in calculating actual sales in a region. There is no system in the registrar office to collate sales data on a regular basis. MahaRERA is a good platform, having the provision of showing the units sold. We observe many of the developers do not update the data on a quarterly basis,” a representative of JLL said.

Anarock Property Consultants chairman Anurj Puri said the lack of official data on registration “impacts the overall estimates to some extent”. He said, “More accurate official data may largely help in giving the sales scenario in the secondary or the re-sale market.”

343,['8/01/2020'],Access marriage records from 1914 to 2010 online,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Panaji: The state government has successfully digitised marriage records from 1914 to 2010 — covering almost a century. Basically marriage records since 1914, when the Portuguese enforced the uniform civil code in the state, can be accessed online.

If a citizen wants to search the record of his/her marriage registered in the state, he or she may access it by visiting www.goaonline.gov.in and registering themselves to avail the service, which was launched by chief minister Pramod Sawant along with law minister Nilesh Cabral on Tuesday.

With the new system becoming functional, citizens won’t have to visit a taluka registrar’s office to search for marriage records between 1914 and 2010. People can visit the website, search, view and download a non-certified marriage record. Cabral said for now people will still have to visit a taluka registrar office to get certified copies, but shortly marriage certificates will be available online.

The chief minister termed the latest service by the state registrar office as “historic” in the country.

“It is a big achievement for Goa to make marriage records of the Portuguese-era online,” Sawant said.

Cabral said credit must be given to the chief minister who intervened to sort out the matter with Prithvi Services Pvt Ltd, which was appointed, in 2010, for digitising the documents. The dispute with the agency was resolved amicably, he said.

About 8,60,000 documents have been scanned and uploaded. The marriage documents from 2010 to 2019 will also be made available online in coming months, he said.

On an average, 12,000 marriages are registered in the state. The new facility has been launched in association with Goa Electronic Ltd, under e-District mission mode project.

Cabral said the state registrar’s office has become over 99% corruption-free.

Voters stand in a queue at a booth in Dhule in the ZP polls.

NASHIK: After Nashik, the BJP is again up against the Maha Vikas Aghadi in the zilla parishad elections in Dhule and Nandurbar . The voting for the 56 seats in each of the two ZPs took place on Tuesday with a voters’ turnout of nearly 65% both in Dhule and Nandurbar.

In Dhule, BJP has put up candidates in all the 56 seats and the local unit exuded confidence that it would be able to defeat the combine Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP in the election.

“In five seats, we have won uncontested as the opposition failed to put up candidates. We are confident that our party will win the ZP polls in Dhule,” Anup Agarwal, the district BJP president said.

However, the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena combine is set to give BJP a run for its money. While Congress is contesting in 27 seats, NCP has put up candidates in 21 seats. Sena has put up candidates in the few of the remaining seats.

Former Dhule city MLA Anil Gote, who joined NCP recently, said the united opposition would ensure that the anti-BJP votes do not get split. “The BJP camp should not rejoice as they won five seats uncontested. Our combine will come to power,” added Gote.

In the tribal-dominated Nandurbar, BJP is locked in a direct contest with Congress in the ZP polls. Unlike Dhule, the Congress, Sena and NCP could not reach a pre-poll understanding here and all these parties are contesting the polls independently.

Despite this, BJP insiders in Nandubar admitted that it would be difficult for the party to win the ZP polls. BJP is contesting all the 56 seats, while Congress has put up candidates in over 48 seats. Similarly NCP candidates are in fray in over 37 seats and Sena in 41 seats.

“There is a pro Congress wave in many parts of the district as its legislator from Akkalkuwa, K C Padvi, has been made the tribal welfare minister in the new state government. We apprehend that it would help Congress win a majority in the seats,” said a BJP functionary from the district.

Pune: Four soldiers, including a Major, who had sustained multiple injuries during an internal exercise, have recovered in the last 12 days and are out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Military Hospital Khadki.

Two soldiers were killed while nine soldiers suffered injuries when heavy metal panels fell on them during construction of a Bailey suspension bridge as part of the Combat Engineering Instructor Course at the training node of the College of Military Engineering (CME) on December 26.

“The injured officer has been discharged while the remaining three sappers are still under observation. One sapper is expected to get discharged on Wednesday. None of the soldiers had sustained ‘permanent injury’ in the accident,” a senior army officer from the CME told TOI on Tuesday.

The college has ordered a Court of Inquiry (CoI) to investigate the matter. A Colonel rank officer has been appointed as the presiding officer of the inquiry panel.

“The panel has already recorded statements of some sappers, including Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and Non-Commissioned Offices (NCOs) involved in the exercise. It is probing technical and human errors aspects of the accident. Each facet related to the bridge construction is being validated and probed by the panel and senior officers. Besides, the panel has gone through every detail of the exercise by verifying documents related to it. Each aspect related to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is being verified and investigated by the experts,” another senior army officer from the Corps of Engineers told TOI on condition of anonymity.

The inquiry panel is yet to conclude the inquiry. “Establishing sequence of events is a daunting task. It will have to collate information provided by the sappers who participated, officers and observers in a logical way before giving its presentation and formal report to the higher-ups,” the officer added.

The boy died after he hanged himself from a ceiling fan while the girl, who consumed poison , has been hospitalized in a critical condition. No suicide note was recovered.

Station house officer (SHO) Pathri Sukhpal Singh Mann said, “We found Shashikant’s naked body hanging from the ceiling, while Shivani was found unconscious in the same room.

352,['8/01/2020'],Rajasthan: Family sells ancestral property to set up rescue centre for stray dogs,"This story is from January 8, 2020

JAIPUR: Jyoti Khandelwal of Mount Abu has turned out to be a good samaritan for injured stray dogs . She has set up a rescue centre for the canines at the hill station in Sirohi district by selling a part of her ancestral property.

Now her whole family of three – herself, sister and brother – all highly educated, are fully devoted to the care of stray dogs, leaving aside their careers.

Jyoti said their love for stray canines began about four years ago. She said that a stray dog gave birth to six pups in her neighbourhood. The pups used to cry at night due to the biting cold and hunger. They took them home and it was then that there began a new journey for them and the dogs.

Jyoti said she had to sell off a part of her ancestral house to make money for the initiative. Now, their housing board residence on Abu Road houses the rescue centre on its top two floors, while they stay on the ground floor. The family supports the rescue centre and themselves with some rental income as all the three had left their lucrative careers for tending to the street dogs.

Now, her rescue centre has about 60 street dogs, rescued and rehabilitated after accidents or suffering from various illnesses. She had recently registered the rescue centre as an NGO named ‘People for Street Dogs’ under her sister Chandini Khandelwal as the president. The reason is that it would help them to get some help from the government veterinary hospitals.

Dr Amit Chaudhary, a veterinary surgeon of a government hospital has been of immense help to them to conduct complex operations of the dogs injured in accidents.

The sisters said though they love all animals, the reason for choosing street dogs has been deliberate as it is the most neglected lot. “When we used to telephone the local nagar palika about an injured dog, they used to mock at us saying they had better things to do than tending to dogs,” said Chandini, who is a MSc Biotechnology and law graduate, now acting as the president of the NGO.

Their brother Nayhesh Khandelwal, an engineering graduate, who is an expert in handling even dogs with rabies said, they have initiated tagging dogs with radium belt with numbers, perhaps the first such initiative in the country. He said they had plans to tag 1,200 street dogs on January 16 and are launching immunization of dogs in a big way.

They have been focusing on immunization of street dogs from rabies as people kill rabies-affected dogs straight away.

TimesView Cops have had their hands full keeping the city moving as protests have surged over the last few weeks. It would help — both cops and citizens going about their work — if protesters stay off each other's route and avoid deliberately needling rivals.

KOLKATA: Aware of the emotion of students after the JNU attack, the police brass at Lalbazar has asked the force to be patient, try to open up as many communication channels as possible and show restraint while dealing with young protesters. The advice came hours after education minister Partha Chatterjee posted on Facebook that he was expecting “more restraint” from cops in a reference to the alleged lathicharge near Sulekha crossing on Jadavpur University students on Monday evening.The police efforts to reach out to students begun almost immediately after Chatterjee posted his comment on Monday. To begin with, Kolkata Police posted on their official Twitter handle: “Kolkata Police is making all efforts to cooperate with students and law-abiding citizens to maintain peace. Senior officers are in the Jadavpur area to help you. In case of any assistance or complaints, please contact us immediately.” Thereafter, DC (Jadavpur) Sudip Sarkar met the protesting students along with the Jadavpur OC. The initial provocations notwithstanding, the dialogue helped soothe nerves.The efforts to reach out to students though are a well laid-out strategy that had its genesis in JU’s Hokkolorob movement in 2014. “The midnight action painted us in the negative and it was decided that using force would be the last resort. Days later, during the massive march towards central Kolkata by students, we deliberately shunned our traditional lathi. It was discussed that we will continue with dialogues, create multiple barriers on the march path and bring in various innovations to ensure that law and order is not disturbed. Water cannons, tear gas shells and lathis are to be used only as a last resort. Had the stone pelting not taken place at Sulekha, we can assure that no student would have got caught in our attempt to use mild force to free up the area,” explained an officer.“So much has been the focus on institutes that we have asked Jadavpur and Jorasanko police stations to depute men to open up dialogues with students of JU, Calcutta University and Presidency University,” said a top Lalbazar source.Also, senior officers present at the spot and local cops have been asked to guide those coming from outside for duty. The entire protest is usually videographed, at times beamed live back to the Lalbazar control room. Drones are used during massive rallies. “That helps to see who crossed the line,” said an IPS officer. Traffic, too, now is allowed to flow as much as possible. “The idea is to keep normalcy as much as possible,” added an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73148353,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-582392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-change-with-time-learn-lessons-on-student-control/articleshow/73145521.cms

Shivraj Singh Chouhan

BHOPAL: Reacting to the ‘Free Kashmir’ poster seen at a protest in Mumbai against the JNU violence, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said Kashmir is already free.

“Don’t worry, Kashmir is now free from the draconian Article 370. It’s time to fight to free POK,” Chouhan tweeted on Tuesday, adding: “In the meantime, ‘Free Kashmir’ from Islamic Radicalisation! Free Kashmir from decades of corruption. ‘Free Kashmir’ from shackles of fake stakeholders of Kashmir.”

The protester has clarified that she was referring to the internet shutdown in J&K following the abrogation of Article 370.

Chouhan also accused the Congress government of “not allowing BJP workers and public to hold pro-CAA protest in district headquarters”. “In Ujjain, the public sought permission to hold a peaceful rally in support of citizenship law (CAA) but the administration refused at the instance of the chief minister. The public took out a massive rally. But, the arrogant government registered a case against the organisers. The public will crush their ego,” said Chouhan.

The former CM also criticised the Congress government over law and order. “Madhya Pradesh is screaming. Daughters are not safe. Their screams are heard everywhere. But, their painful voice is not reaching the deaf ears of the government. The government has closed its eyes and ears. What will happen to my daughters, my Madhya Pradesh ? MP wants an answer,” tweeted Chouhan.

Tiruvarur: Statues of former chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa were found unveiled at Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district by unidentified people without obtaining police permission. However, no parties have staked claim for erecting the statues.

M G Ramachandran’s life-size statue was erected by the district wing of the AIADMK on South Street of Mannargudi in 2015. However, owing to some litigation, the statue has not been unveiled till Sunday. Functionaries of the AIADMK had been battling to unveil the statue in a proper manner. A few months ago, wall posters demanding to unveil the MGR statue were appeared around the town.

Meanwhile, to the surprise of the AIADMK, AMMK and the general public alike, the statues of MGR along with a new statue of J Jayalalithaa were found erected on Tuesday morning. However, no parties have staked claim for erecting the statues. The garlanded statues are standing on a tree-foot high pedestal, residents said.

AIADMK functionaries and municipality authorities were unaware of the incident creating confusion among party cadres.

Residents said that some unidentified people arrived there carrying a Jayalalithaa statue in a truck, erected it beside the MGR statue and garlanded them and left the spot.

356,['8/01/2020'],"Justice hurried could be justice buried, warn experts","This story is from January 8, 2020

Visakhapatnam: On December 13 last year, AP became the first state in the country to enact a law aimed at awarding death penalty to those found guilty in specified offences against women . Called the AP Disha Act , it also calls for completion of trial in such cases within 21 days of the arrest of the accused. After it was passed in the assembly, the government released a GO on Dec 31 last year mentioning the provisions and budgetary allocations for the Act.

While hailing the commendable move, most stakeholders, however, feel 21 days could be too short a period to complete investigation and trial in such cases. Senior advocate Kuppili Muralidhar, who has been dealing with such cases for a long time, said examining the witnesses, gathering relevant documents and evidence may not be practically possible within 21 days.

“Just like justice delayed is justice denied, even justice hurried is justice buried, as stated by the Supreme Court in a recent case in which the trial was rushed in 13 days. As per standard operating procedure, the police can take 90 days to file a chargesheet under section 167 of the CRPC. If there are gaps, the court can send back the chargesheet for reevaluation,” said Muralidhar, who is also the president of Forum of Legal Professionals.

“Sometimes, the shocked victim may not be in a psychological and physical condition to give a statement to the police. Taking all these practical problems into consideration, it may not be possible for the police and judiciary to dispose of such cases within 21 days. Instead, six months can be given to dispose of such cases,” he added.

Child rights activist Abdul Raqueeb echoed the same thoughts. “It is not practically possible to dispose of cases within 21 days as reports from forensic labs, including second opinions, often take several weeks or even months to arrive,” said the former panel advocate of Juvenile Justice Board.

The doctors, however, say they can give the victim’s medical examination report within 24 hours. “Our department is equipped to send medical examination reports to the police and dispatch samples collected for forensic tests at the earliest so as not to lose any evidence. But the onus is on the police and judiciary to gather all the evidence, prepare the chargesheet and expedite the trial process. The police should ensure that the forensic labs give them the test reports on a priority basis for Disha cases,” said Dr P V Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College.

Officials of women and child welfare department opine that if adequate and upgraded infrastructure and trained manpower are in place, including exclusive police stations and courts to deal with such cases, it is possible to file the chargesheet within 21 days. “Given the pending of such cases since years, it is important that the investigation and trial is fast-tracked for which upgrading of infrastructure and manpower are a must,” said district child protection officer A Satyanarayana.

Vizag women police station ACP Prem Kajal too said the police can meet the 21-day deadline provided other departments cooperate and give the medical report within 24 hours and forensic lab reports within 72 hours. “If a magistrate is present during recording of statement under Section 164 of CRPC and adequate manpower and infrastructure is available, it is possible to prepare the chargesheet within the stipulated time,” Kajal said.

358,['8/01/2020'],"2,200 more cyber crime plaints in Pune last year","This story is from January 8, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The number of cyber crimes in the city is increasing steadily with the Pune police receiving 7,795 complaints in 2019 as against 5,500 complaints in 2018.

“Our workload is shifting towards cyber and economic offences. We are yet to complete an analysis of the reasons behind the rise, but we feel more needs to be done here,” city police commissioner K Venkatesham said on Tuesday. A separate cyber crime police station was set up in the city in July last year.

The city police has been receiving cyber crime complaints ranging from matrimonial/gift fraud, online job and loan offers fraud, bank transaction fraud, offences originating from posts on social networking sites, crypto currency transactions, internet network system hacking, online sale, insurance policy fraud, use of cell phones for harassment and call centre frauds, among others.

Usually, the cyber police verify the details of letters it receives from complainants, including the mode of commission of crime, before a formal FIR is registered either by the cyber crime police station or the local police station. The process usually takes months to translate into an FIR, depending on the complexities involved in verification of details. However, the number of complaint letters provides a strong indication of the rising trend of cyber crime.

Out of the 7,795 complaint letters last year, 280 letters have translated into FIRs as against 175 cyber crime FIRs registered in 2018 and 214 FIRs in 2017. The police arrested 71 people in relation to cyber crimes in 2019 as against 100 in 2018 and 90 in 2017.

“The actual number of complaints and that translating into FIRs appears to be far less compared to the cyber offences that go unreported,” said lawyer Gaurav Jachak, who specialises in cyber law cases. “There is also the issue of the cyber crime police station having limited number of personnel who are adequately trained and equipped to handle the probe in such cases,” he said.

“Investigation of cyber crime complaints often suffers from prolonged delays in securing information from internet service providers as part of the verification process before an FIR is lodged,” Jachak said.

Former IPS officer Rajendra Sonawane said, “The growing internet penetration and digital transactions has opened avenues for cyber criminals to cash in on the online users’ vulnerability to easy money. The criminals know that the user can be easily defrauded as there is no face-to-face contact and people fall to netbanking, insurance and other online frauds by sharing personal details. Besides, hacking activity also continues during the night hours. Lack of consciousness among the net users is also a factor behind cyber crimes.”

Sonawane said, “To some extent, the rise in cyber crimes also indicates that the criminals are fairly aware about the shortcomings of the police like limited resources and expertise in handling cyber crime cases. Often, it is seen that victims of cyber crimes are senior citizens, women and even those from the IT sector.”

HARIDWAR: The officials of Integrated Power Development System (IPDS) of Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) claim that underground cabling would be completed in Haridwar before the November 2020 deadline set for the Rs 400 crore-worth project.

""We started the construction work in May, 2019, and efforts are being made to complete the project by June 2020,"" project manager Sanjiv Sharma told TOI on Tuesday. The official added that besides finishing the work under the set deadline, IPDS will also maintain the quality of work.

""Once the project is completed, there will be no poles and feeders visible on the streets or in the lanes, except the ones for street lights. This will give the city a smart look,"" Sharma said, while pointing out that Haridwar is the only city in Uttarakhand to have been awarded with underground cabling project by the Central government.

The city has been divided into seven zones for the project and works are going on simultaneously in all the zones. “In the first phase, underground pipes are being laid in 1.5-to-2 metre deep pits and cables are being inserted in the pipes. In the next phase, installation of equipment would take place. And in the last one, equipment will be charged,” Sharma said.

Talking about the quality of work, he said that cross link poly-ethenyl (SLPE) cables are being used in the project and they do not get damaged by water or any atmospheric factors.

Local residents also expressed their delight with the project. “The project will be a great help during Kumbh, 2021, especially in traffic management,” says Vinay Kumar, a Shivaliknagar resident. He added that the project will reduce the power cut issue considerably.

The committee will prepare a report on the status of dams, changes and repair works required and hand it over to the irrigation department at the earliest.

Independent MLA from Bhimtal Ram Singh Kaida through assembly asked irrigation minister Satpal Maharaj if he was aware that the dam on Bhimtal lake was in a “poor condition and in case of further damage it could pose a serious threat to people living in the area.” The MLA said, “After Nainital , most people come to Bhimtal. In case of any damage to the lake, it can lead to major crisis. I would like to ask the minister about steps being taken to make amends.”

He also requested the minister to tell the age of the dam and if any study has been carried out in the past. In his reply, Maharaj said that the Bhimtal lake dam was over 100 years old and was made in the British era. He also mentioned that no study of the dam has been carried out in the past.

“The process to conduct the study of the dam by National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, is under way. The irrigation department workshop of Roorkee will study the gate of the dam. The process to conduct the study is in the final phase,” said the minister.

Congress MLA from Ranikhet Karan Mahra termed it a serious issue saying, “Most parts of Uttarakhand fall in seismic zone 4 and 5. Earthquakes often jolt the state and keeping these factors in mind, it is extremely important to know the present status of bridges and dams which have been made in the state.”

To this, Maharaj said, “We are taking the issue seriously. A Dam Safety Review Committee comprising senior officers and experts will be formed to conduct the study and hand over its detailed report at the earliest.”

Threatened the manager, wanted information about our whereabouts,"" he said, adding that the people (ISI agents) would be coming back tomorrow to get lists of booksellers.

The book shops Fiction House Lahore and Saeed Book Bank Islamabad confirmed the confiscation of copies of the Urdu transalation of Hanif's novel.

His satirical novel, published in English in 2008, chronicles the final days of military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq's rule and the myriad conspiracies behind the plane crash that killed him in 1988. The award-winning book has been widely acclaimed for its comic look at life in Pakistan during the peak of Islamisation that was the hallmark of Zia's leadership tenure. It was released in Urdu in October last year.

In another tweet, Hanif said they had last week received a defamation notice from Gen Zia's son, Ejazul Haq, demanding Rs 1 billion (Pakistani currency) for maligning his father's name. ""Our lawyers are preparing a reply. Is ISI acting on Ejazul Haq's behalf?"" he asked.

Hanif noted that his novel has been in publication for 11 years but no one had a problem with it. ""Nobody has ever bothered me. Why now? I am sitting here wondering when they will come for us. ISI is World's No 1 spy agency. I am sure they have better things to do,"" he tweeted.

His fans on Twitter noted that Hanif might have been able to escape scrutiny so far because his novel was in English, a language that a relatively small percentage of Pakistanis read. With its translation in Urdu hitting shelves just last year, it might have attracted a critical audience that was thus far unaware of its existence.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) ""deplored"" the raid at the publishing house. ""The authorities must revoke this action immediately,"" the HRCP posted on Twitter.

""This is a craven attempt to stifle artistic freedom of expression. The original work, a political satire set in Gen Zia-ul-Haq's time, came out 11 years ago and has remained a bestseller in Pakistan and abroad for years. @mohammedhanif was also awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Pakistan's highest civilian award),"" the HRCP said in a subsequent tweet.

Porvorim: Days after tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar made a case for hosting two electronic dance music ( EDM ) festivals in the state every year, Goa Tourism Development Corporation ( GTDC ) chairman Dayanand Sopte has conveyed to the minister that one festival is adequate.

“I have told the tourism minister that only one EDM must be permitted to be held in the state. We have seen the quality of tourists that such festivals attract. We need quality tourists,” Sopte said.

Asked if EDMs should be banned in Goa due to allegations of drug abuse during the festival, Sopte said he was not opposing EDMs, just the organising of two festivals a year.

Use of drugs and consumption of liquor in the open should be stopped, he said. “We have seen the video clip that was in circulation showing drunk men sleeping on Calangute beach. Such incidents bring Goa a bad name,” Sopte said.

Following the death of three tourists during the recent three-day EDM festival, opposition parties criticised police and the government.

Two tourists had collapsed while waiting in a queue to attend the festival while the third collapsed on the last day of the festival. Police are awaiting the chemical analysis reports to determine the cause of death.

Ports minister Michael Lobo recently said that the government needs to put in more efforts to stop sale of drugs in the state.

Suggestions for improving traffic include removing toll gates within city limits and widening service roads to a minimum of 40 to 60 feet on both sides of highways passing through cities, towns and villages to enable pedestrians, two-wheelers and three-wheelers pass.

The organisation also put forward the need to develop parking areas for trucks on both sides of the city limits, on a minimum of 50 to 100 acres, with adequate infrastructure such as petrol pumps, washrooms, food plazas and vehicle repair services.

It also recommended that road repair works on National Highways--such as filling potholes--be taken up immediately.

NAINITAL: Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal on Tuesday demanded the resignation of the Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) vice-chancellor ( VC ) M jagdesh Kumar and Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik saying that after the violence in the university, the two must be held accountable.

Sibal was in Nainital to represent former chief minister Harish Rawat in the sting operation case. While speaking about violence at JNU, he said that the JNU administration and the Delhi Police failed to protect the students. “The rampage in one of the premier universities of the country continued for hours still neither the police nor the university administration did anything. Therefore, both the VC and the commissioner must resign,” he said.

Sibal, who is also a senior lawyer, questioned the reason for shutting off the street lights in the area when the masked mob attacked the students in JNU. “The street lights were on in the area and police was standing outside the gate of the university. They should explain how the mob entered the university. And what the VC was doing. Why didn’t he inform police and if he did, why didn’t the commissioner take any action?” he said.

More than 30 students, teachers and some officials have been injured in the attack by masked goons in the JNU and police are yet to make any arrests.

When asked about the FIR on students’ union president Aishe Ghosh, Sibal said that this has become the new norm in the country where the victims are booked by police. “We saw it happen in UP, in Kashmir and many other places,” he said.

Comparing the response of the governments in Hong Kong and India, he said that even the people of Hong Kong have been protesting against the Chinese government yet no violence has erupted there. “Masked protests have been going on in Hong Kong for months still there has not been any major news of violence or attack by police. Then why are people being shot in India,” he asked.

COIMBATORE: The state government has sanctioned Rs 7.24 crore for the Coimbatore forest division to take measures to prevent man– animal conflicts.

To start with, the forest department will install thermal imaging cameras with a range of more than 1km to watch elephant movements on forest fringes and inform villagers if the animals come closer to the human habitats.

On July 1, 2019, the state forest minister announced in the assembly that man-animal conflicts had been on the rise in the villages on the forest fringes in Western and Eastern Ghats.

“We have identified 13 vital areas in the forest division where we plan to install thermal imaging cameras. While officials in the control room will alert the range authorities through SMS, the forest field staff will alert villagers,” a forest officer said. The department is also planning to use drones to detect animal movements.

The Coimbatore forest division has seven forest ranges – Madukkarai, Boluvampatti, Coimbatore, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karamadai, Mettupalayam and Sirumugai.

Earlier, the principal chief conservator of forests had sent a proposal for resolving human-elephant conflict through remote-based technology in Coimbatore at a cost of Rs 7.24 crore. Subsequently, the government has sanctioned the money, of which, Rs 6.83 crore was allotted to set up cameras and other systems in the seven ranges and Rs 27.07 lakh for extension of railway track and installation of early warning system.

Besides, the forest department has decided to set up a human – elephant conflict mitigation cell at the district forest officer’s office and estimated the cost as Rs 13.8 lakh.

Thermal imaging cameras are devices which translate thermal energy (heat) emanating from objects into visible light in order to analyse them. The proposed technology can be used to locate wild elephants, humans and conduct search and rescue operations during day and night.

Uttrakhand high court

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Tuesday came down heavily on the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the multi-crore scholarship scam ordering it to submit the investigation reports of all the colleges in Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital districts which have been let off.

This comes after the bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while hearing a clutch of petitions that had flagged embezzlement of funds in awarding scholarship to students from underprivileged backgrounds of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes, on Monday ordered the SIT headed by officer Sanjay Gunjyal to submit the details of investigations done so far in districts other than Dehradun and Haridwar.

The PIL, meanwhile, has also alleged that the benefits of scholarship which was meant for students whose family income is less than Rs 2.5 lakh has been availed by even senior government officials. “They informed the court that so far 52 colleges have been investigated in Nainital, of which FIR has been filed against four colleges while in US Nagar, more than 60 colleges have been investigated and FIR has been filed against 15. The court then asked about the basis on which only 8% colleges in Nainital and only a fourth in US Nagar were booked when in places such as Haridwar and Dehradun, a number of colleges have come under scanner,” said MC Pant, the lawyer appearing for petitioner.

The court has now ordered the SIT to furnish the investigation reports of all the colleges which have been let off till February 10. “We deem it appropriate to satisfy ourselves as to whether the investigation was carried out properly or whether it was shoddy. We therefore consider it appropriate that the head of the SIT will place before us, by the next date of hearing, the investigation report relating to private colleges in US Nagar and Nainital districts who are held not to have indulged in these acts of misappropriation after inquiry,” the court order read.

COIMBATORE: The Nilgiri Biosphere Nature Park in Thuvaipathi, Anaikatti, will host a music concert on January 25 to raise funds to meet the park’s expenses in a long run.

The event, “Ooh la la”, will feature playback singers Haricharan, Anand Aravindakshan and Swetha Mohan and will be compered by Priyanka. The park, which is a botanic garden spread over 70 acres, hopes to raise at least Rs 1 crore from the concert.

The park was an initiative by the Coimbatore Zoological Park and Conservation Centre in 1992 to recreate the bounty of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve , which comprises forests of the Western Ghats covering Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, in a limited zone. The place, which is now home to more than 450 varieties of native trees, flora and fauna, has a butterfly park, an apiary and amphibian ponds.

Though it has become a popular attraction for school and college students and an outbound activity centre for corporates, the entry fee, Rs 25 for children and Rs 50 for adults, hardly earns a third or even lesser of the park’s expenses, a park’s patron said. A group of patrons, mainly comprising of Coimbatore’s industrialists including D Vijay Mohan, G Rangaswamy, D Vidyaprakash and N Krishna Samaraj, helps the park to sustain financially, said chairman of the centre S V Balasubramaniam.

This is the year's first tiger attack reported in Uttrakhand

HARIDWAR: A 34-year-old Van Gujjar Taj Mohammad was attacked by a tiger in Aam Pokhra range of Terai West forest division on Tuesday morning. The victim was referred to Sushila Tiwari Medical College hospital from Ramnagar in a critical state. His condition is told to be stable at present.

“He has sustained deep canine and paw marks in neck area. It was clearly a tiger attack . Our ENT specialist is continuously observing his condition. At present, his vital signs are stable and he has not been kept in the ICU,” said CP Bhaisora, principal of Sushila Tiwari Medical College.

The attack took place when the victim had gone deep into the forest while taking his livestock for grazing. Forest officials say that Taj could escape the big cat as the tiger attacked in self-defence and not to kill.

“When tiger attacks in self-defence, it pounds on the victim and then recedes itself. Such attacks are made when tiger feels threatened by the presence of anyone around itself or its cubs,” said Himanshu Bagri, divisional forest officer, Terai West.

This is the year’s first tiger attack and it comes barely a few days after a pregnant tigress was crushed to death in a road accident in Terai West forest division.

In a similar incident in Western Circle last year, a person had escaped a tiger attack with grave injuries. “Despite repeated instructions, villagers and forest dwellers don’t refrain from entering into restricted or vulnerable areas. This leads to such life-threatening attacks,” added Bagri. The forest department will be compensating the victim by giving an amount in the range of Rs 15,000-Rs 50,000. The amount would depend on the medical certificate provided by the doctor. “In case of minor injuries, we give Rs 15,000 and for grave injuries, we pay Rs 50,000,” explained the official.

Last year, three people were killed in tiger attacks in Uttarakhand, according to the forest department data on human wildlife conflict. All the three victims had lost their lives inside Corbett Tiger Reserve and they all were staff members of the wildlife sanctuary.

Representative image

PUNE: The Ammunition Factory Khadki (AFK) recently paid Rs29.3 crore service charge arrears to the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB).

The payout has come as much-needed relief to the cash-strapped cantonment board, reeling from financial crunch for the past two years.

“We want to be able to provide essential civic facilities to the citizens of the cantonment. The recovered arrears will make our task easier in the coming months,” KCB president Brigadier MJ Kumar told TOI.

Last year, the AFK and High Explosives factories, which are governed by the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), were told to clear Rs47 crore service charges arrears owed to the cantonment board. While the AFK has now released the payment of Rs29.3 crore, the decision on the collection of the remaining Rs17.7 crore is pending before the authorities concerned.

“These ordnance factories pay the service charges for services rendered like maintaining cleanliness on land owned by them. The factories have asked us to give exemption from paying charges for playground and firing range maintenance. But we cannot take a decision on this matter unless the old provisions are changed,” KCB’s chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh said.

As per the provisions of Section 109 of the Cantonment Act, 2006, and guidelines issued by the ministries of urban development and finance, service charges are leviable on the Centre’s properties by the local bodies. This has been further settled by the Supreme Court in 2009 and subsequent judgment of the Allahabad high court .

Singh said the board had to raise revenue inflows from different fronts, as it is yet to get its goods and services tax (GST) share from the state government.

“The cantonment expenses have increased due to expenditure on welfare projects, payment of pending bills. The implementation of 7th Pay Commission has increased the salary expenditure significantly. We had to dip into the board’s fixed deposit, once considered as ‘safe money’, to incur avoidable costs,” a senior KCB official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, the Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) has set up a committee to discuss and address the issues pertaining to the collection of service charges and its legal aspects.

“Recovering service charges has become crucial for cantonments across the country. Due to old records and complexities involved in their respective agreements, it has become a contentious issue for OFB and DGDE. To reach a consensus, the committee will hold its meeting on Wednesday in New Delhi,” a senior official of DGDE told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Pune: Debal Deb is an ecologist of some repute, having fought hard to preserve traditional landraces of rice and other crops.

“Large seed corporations have aggressively marketed genetically modified seeds to farmers, promising higher yields in cash and food crops. But what have these seeds caused to small farmers in India,” Deb asked while speaking about farmers suicides in various parts of India.

On Tuesday, Deb received the top festival honour for his work to preserve, distribute, and grow crops from traditional rice varieties during the closing ceremony of KVIFF. He was also part of an interactive session during the ceremony at Balgandharva Rangmandir.

As part of his work, Deb has a laboratory at his hometown of Kolkata for his work with seeds. In 1996, he founded the seed bank Vrihi, Sanskrit for rice, to store and distribute traditional varieties of seeds.

At a press conference, Deb spoke about the durability of traditional seeds against extreme climates, including a variety that grows in 12 feet deep water, where farm work has to be done using canoes. But, Deb said, the allure of genetically modified seeds is still too large for farmers.

384,['8/01/2020'],Coimbatore: Man held for duping ATM customers,"This story is from January 8, 2020

COIMBATORE: The city police on Monday arrested a 48-year-old man for allegedly cheating people in the garb of helping them to withdraw cash from ATM.

The arrested has been identified as A Kathiresan, 48, of Thirumangalam in Madurai district. He was booked under section 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code and remanded in judicial custody.

According to police, he was held based on the complaint lodged by Suresh Kumar, 46, a resident of Vellalore who works as a home guard with the Podanur police.

On December 19, he had gone to an ATM centre at SIDCO on Coimbatore-Pollachi road at Sundarapuram to withdraw cash. When he was unable to withdraw cash, Kathiresan came to the ATM and offered to help Suresh Kumar. He also attempted to withdraw money by using the debit card belonging to Suresh Kumar but in vain.

A few hours later, Suresh Kumar received messages mentioning that Rs 19,500 was withdrawn from his bank accounts from two ATM centres. On intimating bank officials, Suresh Kumar was informed that the amount was withdrawn using his original ATM card at Othakkalmandapam and Kinathukadavu . Only then Suresh Kumar realized that the man had given him a duplicate card.

Suresh Kumar lodged a complaint with the Podanur police (crime) who arrested Kathiresan on Monday. Kathiresan told police that he had cheated more than 30 people from Madukkarai, Perur, Podanur and Saibaba Colony police station limits. He was lodged in the Coimbatore central prison .

COIMBATORE: A video of women staff changing dress in a room at a petrol bunk in the city went viral on Tuesday. The All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) has petitioned the city police commissioner, seeking action against the man who took the video.

In another development, a male staffer of the petrol bunk was thrashed by other staff when he questioned the management for not acting against the culprit. The wife of the male staffer, Manikandan, also works in the same bunk at Kannappan Nagar.

The video was apparently taken four months ago by one of the staff named Subash. The issue came to light when Manikandan’s wife found a hidden camera in the dressing room while changing her dress. She immediately informed her husband who in turn informed the management. Subash was suspended and a case was registered against him under Section 75 C (1) (creating nuisance) of the Tamil Nadu Police Act by the Saibaba Colony police based on a complaint lodged by the management.

Subash had apparently stored the video on his mobile phone, which was seized by police and the video was deleted.

Meanwhile, the staff of the bunk thrashed Manikandan on Monday when he questioned the management for not taking strict action against Subash. Manikandan was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital with injuries on Monday night.

However, the management of the bunk alleged that Manikandan had stolen petrol from the bunk.

Since Tuesday morning, the 16-minute video of women staff changing dress has gone viral on social media.

In the afternoon, All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) secretary A Rathika and members of AIDWA submitted a petition to city police commissioner Sumit Sharan, demanding the arrest of the person who recorded the video.

Police maintained that they would arrest Subash only if they get a written complaint from the management of the petrol bunk.

Police also suspect Manikandan’s hand in circulation of the video as he would have forwarded the video from Subhas’s mobile phone to his phone before handing it over to the police.

387,['8/01/2020'],Central funds for flood relief inadequate: BS Yediyurappa,"This story is from January 8, 2020

BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: The second instalment of flood relief funds from the Centre, announced on Monday, has left BS Yediyurappa less than cheerful, with the chief minister insisting that it is barely adequate. The CM on Tuesday said he will urge the Union government to release more.

On Monday, the Centre announced it will release Rs 669.8 crore in addition to the Rs 1,200 crore it had released earlier towards flood relief and rehabilitation. The total sum is a small fraction of the loss, which the government pegged at a staggering Rs 38,000 crore.

“The Centre has released assistance in two instalments so far, but it is inadequate given the magnitude of the damage. I will request for more funds and I am confident the Centre will oblige,” Yediyurappa told reporters.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited the state last week, Yediyurappa had urged him — even openly at a function — to release funds. This followed several pleas over the past four months, which barely drew a response from the Centre. Now, the CM himself suggests it’s barely a drop in the ocean.

The opposition has been criticizing both Yediyurappa and the Centre for their handling of the situation and on Tuesday, leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah of the Congress criticised the CM for “misguiding people” on the sum released by the Centre.

Siddaramaiah tweeted, “Reports from State govt officials say only Rs 669 cr of addl funds are released in 2nd instalment as opposed to the claim of Rs 1,870 cr by Karnataka BJP leaders. At a time when manufacturing industries are closing, BJP’s fake news factory is running at full potential "".

In another tweet, he said, “Moved by the plea of chief minister, Yediyurappa, Prime Minister Narendra Modi released an additional Rs 669.8 crore, taking the total amount to Rs 1,869.8 crore. BJP leaders, who are devotees of the god of lies, attempts to depict the total relief amount as 1200+1869.85 = Rs 3,069 cr is ridiculous.”

A high-level committee chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah had sanctioned the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) funds on Monday. While the Press Information Bureau claimed Rs 1,869 crore was approved on Monday, state government officials clarified that the figure included the Rs 1,200 crore released in October.

Meanwhile, sources say the two instalments is all the assistance the state can expect from the Centre towards flood relief. Sources say the Rs 1,870 crore is roughly 60% of the funding — Rs 3,000 cr— which was supposed to be allocated for Karnataka, based on an inter-ministerial team’s assessment of losses in the state.

“Compared to other states for the same period, Karnataka has received the highest amount in flood relief. We cannot expect more,” said a revenue department official, who said the government will not approach the Centre for a special package.

However, revenue minister R Ashoka said the state will pitch for the entire Rs 3,000 crore. “The state government will pursue the matter with the Centre until it releases the entire Rs 3,000 crore. The state government will cover the remainder of the Rs 38,000 crore loss. We will not go back on our word,” Ashoka said. Incidentally, the state has spent about Rs 6,000 crore on relief and rehabilitation so far.

Calcutta High Court

KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday asked the state government to take steps to maintain normalcy so that public life is not affected during the nationwide bandh called by trade unions. Keeping in mind the ongoing JEE (mains) examinations, the state has asked the police to ensure that roads and railway tracks are not blocked. The police has also been directed to take stern action if any school bus is stopped or students are affected.

State transport minister Suvendu Adhikari said about 22% additional buses will ply on Wednesday. “All vehicles registered within Bengal have been insured by the transport department with coverage up to Rs 6 lakh. Any vehicle damaged on Wednesday will be covered under this insurance,” the minister said. He added that in case of any damage to vehicles, FIRs will have to be lodged within 24 hours of the incident and insurance will have to be claimed at the WBTIDCL office at Kasba.

Majority of bank branches are, however, expected to remain shut as five Left- and Congress-backed bank employees’ unions — AIBEA, AIBOA, BEFI, IMBEF and INBOC — have supported the strike.

Schools, such as Don Bosco School and Modern High School, have already announced a closure due to the bandh. South Point School authorities said that if the students fail to turn up, they will not be penalized. Mayor Firhad Hakim said Kolkata Municipal Corporation offices would function as usual on Wednesday.

Kolkata Police will deploy special forces on the roads from 5am and senior officials will monitor the trouble-prone spots. Nearly 5,000 personnel will be deployed on the streets. There would be special deployments at all government offices.

Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said that the Mamata Banerjee government is against any bandh and harassment of people.

The state finance department has asked all employees to attend office on Wednesday and that no casual leave will be granted. Those staying away on January 8 will be issued showcause notices. The HC Bar Association has appealed that no ex-parte orders be passed by the HC if lawyers failed to attend the court.

PUNE: Reduction in sanctioned posts and inordinate delay in filling those vacant have severely hampered the monitoring of tuberculosis control in the city.Some of the key posts of workers, technicians and supervisors directly involved in tuberculosis (TB) screening, treatment monitoring and follow-ups have been lying vacant in the city TB unit for more than five years now. Besides, the number of sanctioned posts for the city TB unit has been reduced to 54 this year from 63 earlier.“As per the earlier sanctioned posts, we currently have 21 crucial posts lying vacant in the city TB unit for more than five years. Of the 21 posts, the state officials have curtailed 10 posts this year. We have already raised concerns over the sudden downsizing with the higher authorities. In all, the vacant posts are hampering the routine work of TB control in the city. We are making the most of available human resource to keep things in check,” city TB officer Vaishali Jadhav told TOI.Earlier, civic officials had the authority to release the recruitment advertisement and fill up the vacant posts. “However, as per the latest diktat, we cannot carry out the recruitment as the responsibility has been shifted to state officials,” Jadhav said.Among the important posts required for routine monitoring work are the posts of health volunteers, laboratory and overall TB supervisors. “The health volunteers are the field workers who keep track of TB patients till they are cured. They ensure that patients maintain drug compliance by visiting them regularly. Similarly, laboratory supervisors carry out diagnostic tests and senior TB supervisors ensure coordination among the field staff,” Jadhav said.When contacted state TB officer Padmaja Jogewar, joint director of the state health department was in a meeting.

390,['8/01/2020'],Coimbatore: Corporation may seek Anna University aid to study rise in garbage generation,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Coimbatore: The Coimbatore Corporation is likely to approach Anna University or a private concern, which specializes in the field of solid waste management, to study the reasons behind the sudden raise in the garbage generation in the city.

In the last few months, the quantity of garbage dumped in the Vellalore dump yard has increased from 800 tonnes to 1,000 – 1,200 tonnes per day.

To understand the actual reasons behind it and to design projects for the scientific disposal of the wastes, the corporation sought the assistance of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) a couple of months ago.

“The civic body requested the university to conduct the study on three aspects – quantification, composition and analyzing the quality of the wastes. But the university agreed to do the analysis part alone,” a corporation source said.

“The exact contents, like percentage of heavy metals, its caloric values and pH value, could be figured out only through analysis. Based on the results, the corporation could design a project for the safe disposal of the garbage. For example, if the presence of heavy metal is high at the garbage collected from a collection point, then it could not be turned into compost and a different solution needs to be found out,” the source explained.

But it is only the last stage of the study and before that we will have understand the two other aspects, the source said, explaining that by studying the composition of the garbage, percentage of recyclable wastes, biodegradable wastes, non-biodegradable wastes and hazardous wastes could be identified.

As the TNAU is firm on its stand that they could do only analysis part, we have no option but to look for alternative source to conduct the study, the source said, adding that they have been planning to approach either Anna University or a private company who has specialized in the field of solid waste management.

An official from the university said the discussion is still in the preliminary stage and they are yet to arrive at a final decision.

“There are about 500 garbage collection points in the city, so the number of samples that would be involved in the process on the daily basis would be really high. With the limited manpower that the university has, we could extend our assistance only to an extent. So, we have asked the corporation to provide us the final samples to analyze them,” the official added.

Minister of state for women empowerment and child development Rekha Arya at the state assembly on Tuesday

DEHRADUN: In response to anganwadi workers protesting for better pay and facilities, minister of state for women empowerment and child development said that Uttarakhand provided better wages to the workers than its neighbouring states.

“There are 20,066 anganwadi workers and assistants in the state, apart from 14,900 mini anganwadi workers. We give a monthly honorarium of Rs 7,500 to anganwadi workers, Rs 3,750 to their assistants and Rs 4,750 to mini anganwadi workers. The honorarium given by us is better than that given by neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh .”

Arya also denied the anganwadi workers’ claim that the state government didn’t listen to their issues. “Several delegations of anganwadi members have met me and we have discussed their issues in length. It is wrong to say that no one from the state government has met them. As for their meeting with the CM, I will soon meet him and we will decide a time for the meeting,” Arya said.

Independent MLA from Dhanaulti Pritam Singh Panwar said, “It is unfortunate that for over a month, anganwadi workers have been staging a protest, but no one from the state government is bothered to address their issue. They have tried to approach the chief minister on numerous occasions but he is yet to take out time for them. The matter needs to be taken up seriously, as it is directly linked with thousands of women and their families.”

Arya contended that the honorarium of anganwadi workers had been raised in 2018 and would be increased again, if needed. On the issue of keeping tabs on a worker’s attendance through the smart phone given to her, the minister said that it was a directive of the union government and had to be complied with. However, if a worker’s phone got damaged, the cost of its repair would be reimbursed at the block level, she added.

While the age limit for anganwadi workers of general category is 45 years, there is a relaxation of five years for those belonging to reserved categories.

COIMBATORE: As part of lake beautification and restoration project, the city corporation has strated to set up floating decks in Valankulam lake .

The first-of-its-kind attraction in the city seems to have gone down well with the public, who have started to throng the lake in large numbers to watch the work that is underway.

The restoration and rejuvenation of the lake was commenced nearly one and half years ago at a cost of Rs 24.31 crore.

“The project includes components like walkers’ plaza, children’s play area, non-motorized tracks and food kiosks. Floating decks are just one of the components that would provide recreational space for the public,” said a source with the city corporation.

The floating decks have already gained a lot of public attention. S Vijayalakshmi, a commuter, said, “With the ongoing works, the lake has started to look beautiful. It is one of the productive steps taken by the city corporation. The lakes were once filled with sewage and garbage.”

She said people would for sure throng the lake just to experience a walk on the decks. “There is a need to maintain it properly.”

The city corporation has, meanwhile, obtained the high-power committee’s approval to implement the lake restoration and rejuvenation project at Kurichi lake at a cost of Rs 52 crore.

Under the project, the city corporation source said, a vehicular lane, cycle track, footpath, kids’ play zone and a Japanese garden that comprises a green community centre and a viewing deck would be set up along the lake. “We would also improve the stormwater and waste management along the lake.”

Nashik: The Regional Transport Office ( RTO ) has initiated a drive against vehicles ferrying school students to check if buses and vans are following the laid down norms and to refrain autorickshaw drivers from transporting pupils.

A senior police officer said they have formed three squads to check if school buses and vans were adhering to the rules regarding safety of the students. “At the same time, we are also checking if these vehicles have a valid permit,” he said, adding that the drive will conclude on January 14.

While figures of action taken against vehicles concerned could not be known till late evening, the RTO official said their aim was to penalize maximum number of drivers who were carrying more than permissible number of students, driving without permit, among other offences.

“We also appealed to the autorickshaw drivers to refrain from ferrying school students as we would soon start taking strict action against all autorickshaw drivers found ferrying school students,” he said.

Parents of large number of students are against the ban on autorickshaws for ferrying students as the bus service is extremely poor and at the same all schools in the city do not have their own bus service.

Last month, the RTO had received instructions from the state transport department to take action against rickshaws ferrying students.

“During our week-long drive we would take action against erring school bus and van drivers and at the same time also take action against rickshaw drivers who carrying more than permissible number of seats in their vehicles,” the officer said.

“The three squads are taking action in different parts of the city. The combined figures of the action taken by the concerned squads would be available on Wednesday,” he added.

Meanwhile, police have also decided to conduct a meeting with parents to inform them about the hazards of sending their children to school by autorickshaws. The meetings will be conducted at school-level across the city.

DEHRADUN: Soon after the question hour came to an end, the opposition Congress pointed at the vacant chair of bureaucrats in the state assembly saying, “This shows the intent of the state government and the seriousness of officers on important issues.” The issue led to a verbal tussle between Congress MLA and state chief Pritam Singh and forest minister Harak Singh Rawat .

On the issue Pritam Singh said, “On one end, the ministers are unable to provide satisfactory answers and the bureaucrats, who are supposed to help them, are missing. There is not a single official present in the House and that too at a time when the ministers are unable to provide satisfactory answer.”

In a sarcastic jibe, Rawat said, “At times, Singh tries to prove himself senior and at times junior to me. It looks like the number of his eye lens has increased. Two officers are seated on the seats allotted to them but unfortunately he cannot see them.”

Taking a serious note, Singh termed Rawat’s remark as “objectionable” and added, “On several occasions, the ministers have found themselves cornered on various issues and have been unable to provide even the simplest of answers. The absence of state bureaucrats shows that even the officers do not take the ministers seriously. My friend, it is a serious issue and a major concern for the government.”

KOLKATA: A man in his 50s was caught by locals and handed over to the police on Monday night for allegedly trying to preserve the body of his elderly brother-in-law in a trunk, using ice blocks, at Regent Colony in Tollygunge .

His wife and daughter were away on a vacation in Shimla. Cops have sent the body for post-mortem and detained the accused, Biswanath Das .

Locals were alerted by a stench and water seeping out of the house of Samir Ranjan Sur (68) around 8.30pm. When they knocked on the door, Das answered. Locals followed the trail of the water to find Sur’s body lying on an iron trunk filled with ice blocks.

Das claimed Sur had died earlier in the day and since his wife and daughter were away, he was preserving the body. But locals called the police, who sent the body for post-mortem and sealed the house.

“Das said he used to go to Sur’s residence to feed him. On Monday, he found that Sur was dead. He informed his elder sister, Sur’s wife and his niece, over phone. So, Das got hold of a death certificate from a local doctor and arranged to keep the body in the house. Some locals alleged that the accused had tortured Sur to death. We registered a case of unnatural death,” a senior officer said.

A few locals also alleged that Sur was tortured even by his wife and daughter to pressure him to sell the two-storey house.

Rachana Barik, a neighbour, said,“We knew Sur had been too sick to get out of bed. But when I saw Das bringing in large blocks of ice, we became suspicious.” “Eventually, when we questioned him, the entire incident was revealed,” she added.

398,['8/01/2020'],Uttrakhand assembly ratifies bill to extend quota to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies,"This story is from January 8, 2020

A special session of Uttrakhand assembly was held on Tuesday

DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand assembly in a special Session on Tuesday unanimously ratified the Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill, 2019, which proposes to extend quota to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years. However, no such extension was provided to Anglo Indian quota in state assemblies and Lok Sabha.

The Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on December 10 and 12, respectively, in 2019. The provisions under the Bill will be effective from January 25, 2020. As per Article 168 of the Constitution, the Bill must be ratified by at least 50% of the state assemblies before its implementation.

In his speech, parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that, “BR Ambedkar had called the constitution a document of social justice. There has been an improvement in the present scenario but it is still required. Therefore, the Centre has decided to extend it for another 10 years.”

Presently, there are over 20 crore members of SC community and 10.39 crore STs in the country. “The need for this reservation was felt as despite efforts more efforts are required for uniformity. All of us sitting here believe that in the overall development of the county and its people and it was not possible without the growth of SCs/STs,” he added.

“As for the second issue of Anglo Indian, their total count in the country is 296. I have the data of most states on basis of the census of the country. It is an authentic number,” Kaushik said, adding that the tenure of present Anglo Indian nominated member will continue till the stipulated time but will not be extended further.

“This is a historic movement and the entire country has welcomed the move,” he added.

BJP MLA from SC reserve seat of Pauri, Mukesh Koli said, “There is no denying the fact that earlier there was a lot of discrimination but the situation has changed a lot. Earlier, be it marriage or any other functions, SCs and STs were avoided but it is not so now, things have changed. However, at the same time, more efforts are required in this direction. We welcome the move aimed for betterment of SC/STs.”

Leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh said, “We are in favour of the decision to extend quota to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years. However, it would have been better if the Anglo Indians were also given a similar extension.”

Congress state chief and Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh said that one should not forget the contribution of Anglo Indians in shaping and strengthening the society. “In different fields they have played an important role for the country,” he added.

Deputy leader of opposition Karan Mahra said, “The Anglo Indians should not be sidelined on the basis of number. They have contributed immensely for the society and country.”

Incidentally, the reservation for members of SC and ST community, given to them for past 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, is due to end on January 25, 2020. The Lok Sabha passed the constitutional amendment bill to this effect in early December last year, which now has to be ratified by at least 50% of the assemblies before it comes into force.

KOLKATA: A 25-year-old Jadavpur University student, a known face in the anti-CAA movement in Kolkata, who played a crucial role in drumming up support for the protest march to Sulekha on Monday, claimed to have received rape and murder threat on social media on Tuesday morning.The student approached her friend, who in turn, alerted Kolkata Police on their Facebook page about the threat, which was riddled with obscene and undemocratic statements about the woman and her family. The student herself later narrated the incident on her Facebook page, and received immense support from peers. Though the cops’ cyber cell has not yet registered a formal complaint, sources said they were monitoring all such threat and hate messages. “We are not ruling out the chance that the accused might be involved in a number of similar cases,” said an officer.The threat, however, could not dent her confidence or determination to fight the new citizenship law and the attack on JNU. Unfazed, she joined another protest rally in the city. “I had tried to engage with them before. But they are paid for what they do. Engaging with them makes little sense,” she wrote to her friend on FB.She later told TOI that cops called her up but expressed certain problems in taking legal recourse. “But I told them that it was a cyber crime that they need to probe under mandate. They told me to send them a mail with the entire complaint and I am in the process of doing that,” she said. Police, however, denied not to have treated her complaint seriously. But by evening, the complaint was blocked from being viewed on the FB page. “We are taking legal opinions on what can be done next,” an officer said.CID sources said their probe into online trolling had so far found several groups active on Facebook who “choose their targets on the anti-national plank”. “These groups target individuals, especially those with different opinions, and instigate others like themselves to join them in the online trolling.

401,['8/01/2020'],Over 60% vehicles arriving at toll plazas still without FASTags,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nashik: With January 15 deadline fast approaching for FASTags being mandatory to pay fees at toll plazas , over 60% vehicles arriving at toll booths in Nashik on the Mumbai-Agra highway are still without the Radio-frequency identification (RFID) enabled tag.

Initially, it was decided to make FASTags compulsory at all toll plazas across the country from December 15, 2019. However, the deadline was later postponed to January 15 given the unavailability of FASTags.

An official from National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) said though the deadline of FASTags has been extended by a month, a large number of motorists are still paying the fees by cash.

“Around 80% of the motorists arriving at the Ghoti toll plaza did not have the FASTag. Motorists arriving without FASTags at Pimpalgaon toll plaza are around 60%, while at Chandwad toll plaza the number is around 65%,” he said.

“Though the FASTags are available at toll plazas and various banks, many people said they have made online application for the FASTags with their banks, but are yet to receive it,” he added.

Harshal Pawar, marketing executive, said, “I often travel to my native place in Dhule but of late did not get the opportunity to travel by my car. Still I decided to buy the FASTag online. It has been over 15 days since I applied for one, but I am yet to receive it,” he said.

The NHAI official, however, said that FASTags are available in sufficient numbers with the toll plazas. “There will be only one lane for cash payment at toll plazas from January 15. Thus, the rush of such vehicles in that single lane can only be imagined,” he said, adding that motorists should ensure that they buy the FASTag before January 15 to avoid inconvenience.

“Those entering the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) lanes at the toll plazas despite not having the FASTag will have to pay double toll fee, the official said.

Nashik: The mistake of writing down the personal identification numbers (PIN) on the debit cards cost an elderly woman dear as she lost Rs 70,000 from her bank accounts after her wallet containing the cards was stolen from an auto-rickshaw on Saturday.

An officer from Upnagar police station said they would collect the footage from Automated Teller Machine (ATM) kiosk from where the money was withdrawn to ascertain the identity of the suspect.

The complainant, a 70-year-old woman from Shikhrewadi, took a sharing autorickshaw from the Central Bus Stand (CBS) at 11 am on Tuesday.

While she was travelling home from CBS, some unidentified passenger opened her bag and stole the wallet containing her Aadhar Card, PAN card, driving license, registration certificate (RC) of a her vehicle, a medical card and two ATM cards of different banks.

“The woman had written the PINs on the debit cards. Thus, the suspect had no trouble in entering withdrawing the cash from ATMs. The suspect withdrew Rs 20,000 from one card and Rs 50,000 from another,” the officer said.

“The suspect must have been captured by the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera at the ATM centre while withdrawing the cash. This will help us identify him,” he added.

Meanwhile, Upnagar police registered another case against an unidentified conman for duping a 69-year-old man of Rs 14,000 at an ATM kiosk in Nashik Road area.

The complainant, a resident of Jail Road, said he went to an ATM centre near Durga Mandir in Nashik Road at around 12 noon, when the conman watched him pressing the PIN on the ATM.

The suspect then somehow managed to replace the complainant’s debit card with another card and later withdrew Rs 14,000.

Amaravati: Making an indirect reference to the plan about shifting the capital city, chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy said the government wanted to ensure overall development of the state.

He said the government was focused on reducing unnecessary expenditure.

Addressing bankers at State Level Banker Committee (SLBC) meeting here on Tuesday, the CM said the government’s priority was judicious use of resources. “You might be reading headlines in newspapers for the past few days. We are taking every decision with an eye on the state’s future,” said the CM indirectly hinting at controversies around plans to shift the capital city.

The CM said the government has many ambitious plans such as completing irrigation projects in underdeveloped regions and it needed support from bankers. He said that Godavari-Penna linkage project, completion of all major irrigation projects in north-coastal region, Rayalaseema and Polavaram project were top of the government agenda.

He said that water reserves in the Krishna basin have dwindled in the last decade while about 3,000 tmc untapped water in the Godavari is going into ocean. “We can put economic growth on fast track only by completing major irrigation projects,” said the chief minister.

404,['8/01/2020'],Another blow for flood-hit farmers as mills refuse to buy sugarcane,"Representative image

TimesView Karnataka is witnessing one of the worst instances of agrarian distress due to last year’s floods and the biggest victims are sugarcane farmers. The lack of government effort to provide relief has added to their woe. The decision of mills to reject produce has come as the last straw. A big reason for the crisis is the dominance of private mills over cooperative ones. The government must focus on reviving cooperative mills as it will ensure politicians and rich farmers do not call the shots.

BENGALURU: Sugarcane farmers who toiled and salvaged their crops from devastating floods that hit North Karnataka last year, face a bigger challenge that could see all their efforts go in vain — indifferent sugar mills.Sugar mills are reportedly shunning produce from Belagavi, Bagalkot and Gadag districts — the districts that were the most severely affected by floods — citing poor quality.“We are into the second month of the harvest season, but no mill has evinced interest in purchasing our crops,” said Subhash Siraguru, a farmer leader from Bagalkot. “They say it is of low quality because it was affected by floodwaters.”Thousands of acres of sugarcane crops were affected in the three districts as fields were inundated with floodwater for weeks in August last year. As a result, the cane is stunted. Sugar yield is also expected to be low as farmers did not water their crops after floodwaters receded for fear that the moisture would destroy it completely.Now, mills are reluctant to purchase cane from the affected regions fearing low confection. “How can we be expected to purchase sugarcane that has no sugar content at all?” asked a sugar mill owner.Cane growers are now at their wits’ end. Many had lost houses and other crops in the floods and were hoping to secure some income through sale of cane. They are willing to take a price cut.“We know the quality is not very good which is why we are asking mills to pay less than what they are paying for good quality cane. But they are not heeding our requests,” said Dundappa, a farmer from Mudhol, who cultivated sugarcane on 20 acres. He also wanted the government to intervene and direct mills to buy produce on humanitarian grounds.Farmers in Bagalkot district too have pleaded with mill owners to buy their produce, but in vain. “Last week we met Nirani Sugars and Ugar Sugars with a request to purchase cane affected by flood. They responded positively, but nothing has happened so far,” said Subhash, a farmer, who also called for government intervention.However, some mill owners say they have been purchasing cane from flood-affected regions and are only rejecting crops which are completely damaged.“We are aware of the problems our farmers face and we have been purchasing as much sugarcane from flood-affected areas as we can. Even in Belagavi district, which was the worst hit, cane is being purchased. But the problem is with cane that has no sugar yield at all. It is difficult for mills to purchase it,” said Sangamesh Nirani of Nirani Sugars, Mudhol.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73150063,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73326,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/another-blow-for-flood-hit-farmers-as-mills-refuse-to-buy-sugarcane/articleshow/73145371.cms
405,['8/01/2020'],Doubling farmers’ income a far cry in T,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Hyderabad: The much-hyped promise of doubling farmers’ income (DFI) by the state government remains a far cry in Telangana. Despite the implementation of direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes like Rythu Bandhu, the average income of farmers continues to hover between Rs 4,800 and Rs 5,000 per month. This has been the trend in the last five years.

With the Ashok Dalwai Committee on DFI estimating that farmers’ income in Telangana will not touch more than Rs 11,000 a month even in 2022-23, agriculture experts said a scientific approach is the need of the hour to achieve a higher farmers’ cumulative income. The Centre had constituted the Dalwai committee in April 2016 to recommend measures required to fulfil the target after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to double farmers’ income in six years.

The major reasons cited for the incomes not going up as desired are increasing costs of agriculture inputs, increased risk in farming, decreasing government support, unremunerative price and increasing costs of living.

Experts said direct income support measures could help narrow down the gap in incomes when farmers’ families fall below a minimum income level needed for a dignified living. Though the Rythu Bandhu scheme falls under the investment support category, it hasn’t really paid the dividends for the farmers, point out experts.

“There is no particular data to arrive at a rational number on the investment support for farmers. Nothing can be said if Rs 6,000 per family per year or Rs 4,000 per acre per year is enough,” GV Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) pointed out.

He said whenever government employees’ salaries had to be increased, the pay revision commission looks into factors like cost of living, annual increase linked to wholesale price index, etc. “However, when it comes to farmers’ incomes, none of this is taken into consideration,” he explained.

Agriculture activists argue that a farmers’ income security system should be introduced through an Act. “Real cultivators should be identified who could be tenant farmers or sharecroppers so that they benefit instead of absentee landlords,” an activist said.

According to the report of the Dalwai committee, the average annual income of the farmer at the national level was estimated at Rs 96,703 in 2015-16. The targeted annual income of a farmer at the national level should be Rs 1,56,154 (at 2015-16 constant price) or Rs 2,42,998 at current price in 2022-23, the committee had said in its report.

406,['8/01/2020'],High power committee in favour of decentralisation,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Vijayawada: The high power committee consisting of ministers, IAS and IPS officers positively responded to the two reports submitted on decentralization of power, including the state capital. The committee, at its meeting on Tuesday, looked into the recommendations of the two committees that were constituted by the government on the issue.

The expert committees headed by retired IAS officer G N Rao and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) have recommended decentralization of power and trifurcation capital. The GN Rao committee recommended relocation of judicial capital (high court) to Kurnool, executive capital (secretariat) to Visakhapatnam, while retaining the legislative capital (assembly) in Amaravati .

However, the BCG, while recommending three capitals, went one step forward by distributing the executive into six groups and favoured Amaravati and Visakhapatnam.

The high power committee, headed by finance minister Buggana Rajendranath, too is said to have favoured distribution of various government departments between Visakhapatnam and Amaravati, as suggested by the BCG. The committee, in principle, also agreed to observations of the two committees that construction of capital in Amaravati would be a financial burden on the government.

The committee observed that both the GN Rao committee and the BCG have pointed out financial constraints before the government in continuing the capital project in Amaravati as proposed by the previous government. It also referred to the recommendations of the Siva Ramakrishnan committee on the capital, which recommended against financial burden to the government by going for a huge architectural capital. The Ramakrishnan committee, too, had recommended decentralization of development, including the capital, but did not recommend concentration of government offices in one location based on the Hyderabad experience. This point, too, was discussed at the meeting of the high power committee, sources told TOI.

The committee also listened to the views of retired IAS officer G N Rao, who headed the expert committee. The retired bureaucrat reportedly gave a comparative presentation of his report and that of the BCG for the benefit of the members of the high power committee.

The committee has now decided to hold more meetings in the next two weeks and submit its recommendations to the government by January 20.

Hyderabad: Slogans of ‘JNU tum Sanghrash karo, hum tumhare sath hain’ ( JNU students march ahead, we stand with you) resonated at Osmania University Arts College on Monday where students, women activists among others participated in a protest. Students of Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) and University of Hyderabad (UoH) also staged protests on their campuses.

At OU, close to 200 people participated in the protest condemning the brutal attack on JNU students on Sunday midnight. Amidst tight security, students stood with placards and raised slogans of ‘students unity zindabad’. Many were wearing black badges.

OU students held a rally from Arts College towards administrative building and EFLU students also joined the rally. “What happened in JNU seems like a systematic attack by a group of people. Universities should be open for discussions where students need not go through a formal bureaucratic gateway to hold protests, considering spaces where people can raise voices of dissent are shrinking day by day,” said Darun, research scholar at EFLU.

NSUI members held a ‘Shavyatra’ of BJP, while flash protests and candle-light marches were held at Sathupally, Ambedkar Statue at Tank Bund, People’s Plaza and Darulshifa. ABVP members held a protest and blamed left-wing student organisations for the incident.

The Students Union of MANUU accused ABVP members for JNU violence and claimed it is a futile attempt to divert attention from protests against CAA and NRC. “Government wants to muzzle the voice of students against CAA, NRC, NPR,” said Ataullah Niazi, former president of Manuu Students Union.

“As there is no opposition, the youth are the only ones questioning the government on their wrongdoings. That’s why the government is attacking students of varsities — Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, JNU. If we don’t protest now, next can be Manuu or UoH,” said Faizan Sarwar, national joint secretary of All India Students Association, who was part of protest at Manuu.

Shouting slogans against Delhi police and JNU administration, the teaching and non-teaching staff, who organised a procession from Directorate of Distance Education to main gate of the university, said lately no one is safe at varsities. “It is shameful that JNU students and teachers are targeted for raising their voice against fee hike,” said Firoz Alam, Manuu professor.

UoH students had organised midnight flash protest on Sunday. “The Centre is attacking on constitution, rights of people, attacking students mentally and physically through police, ABVP and RSS. Being united has become more necessary than ever as the PM himself is addressing protesters as tukde-tukde gang and urban naxals,” said Abhishek Nandan, president, UoH Student Union.

KOLKATA: The Railway Board has approved the temporary level-crossing on the tracks under the arterial Tallah Bridge for heavy vehicles when the structure is demolished.

Prodded by the state public works department (PWD), Eastern Railway (ER) had recently submitted the proposal for the level-crossing to Railway Board to facilitate movement during the reconstruction of the Tallah road overbridge (ROB).

ER pegged the cost of building the level crossing at Rs 14 crore. PWD has given the money to the railways, which will start setting up the level-crossing near the Chitpur lockgate flyover.

The 625m ROB is due to be razed in April.

Railway officials said the level-crossing will be operational for five years. The state will bear the cost of construction, maintenance and manning the level-crossing. In case the new bridge is not commissioned in five years, the level crossing will be retained as required.

The railways, on the state government’s request, cited an exceptional situation — the unsafe condition of the Tallah bridge — to set up the temporary level crossing. There is a blanket ban by the ministry of railways on new level crossings in sub-urban sections to prevent accidents.

Nashik: The 25 Anganwadis that have been allotted to a private firm are doing quite well in terms of child development through reform in the education system, the child development project officer of the Union ministry of women and child development said here on Tuesday.

The official, Sunil Dusane , was in Nashik to review the functioning of the 25 Anganwadis. The ministry had roped in a private entity, Ampersand, under the PPP ( Public Private Partnership) model to improve the quality of teachers in the Anganwadis to strengthen the concept of early childhood training.

“The 25 Anganwadis that were allotted to this company are doing better than before as the teachers now can explain various concepts to the students through digital aids. After the age of six, when the child is sent to primary schools, he/she is ready for advanced education,” said Dusane.

“It took one-and-a-half years and 175 hours of training to the teachers as the minimum eligibility criterion of the teachers appointed by the government is SSC pass. They are called Anganwadi Sevikas and require extensive training in lesson planning and technology teaching,” said Dusane.

The private company has established Adarsh Anganwadis in the district. Reeta Sonawat, director, Early Childhood Education, Ampersand, said, “Fortunately, our teachers are highly motivated. They learnt through experiential training that a child’s 90% brain develops by the age of six.”

Leaving classrooms empty, the students assembled on the lawns around 10am. They were joined by teachers too

NEW DELHI: As there was a call for a nationwide strike on Wednesday, it was the students of St Stephen’s College coming out to protest, that took everyone by surprise. Many applauded the students of the college for standing in solidarity with their counterparts from Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

Students of the DU college braved rain to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens.

A teacher, Ashley NP, said that this was for the first time in 30 years after Mandal agitations that students of the college went on strike and boycotted classes. Leaving classrooms empty, they walked towards the lawns to join the protest around 10 am.

Raman Mohora, president of the student’s union, said that almost all the students of the college participated in the protest. “It was a collective decision that the students of the college took. The movement across the country is being led and inspired by women. Even in Stephen’s too, that happened,” said Mohora.

Shouting slogans of azadi, reciting poems and carrying placards, students marched around the college. They later marched along with other Delhi University colleges. Students stuck posters on the doors of students’ common room, which read, “hum kaagaz nahin dekhaenge” and “Chankrasheekar Azad ko azad karo”.

The students even read the Preamble as teachers joined them. Mathematics teacher Nandita Narain addressed the students in the college and they sang songs by Faiz Ahmed Faiz — “Laazim hai ki hum bhi dekhenge”. Among several placards, a few read: “We are here for rights and not riots” and “The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis”.

“It was heartwarming to see almost entire college coming out together to protest,” said a student, who did not want to be named.

As pictures of the students protesting in the campus started getting circulated on social media, the alumni of the college took to twitter.

Actor Richa Chadha tweeted, “Alma..mater speaking on what matters.” While Konkana Sen Sharma put an emoji of a red heart on the pictures of the protest.

Journalist and author, Saba Naqvi, said, “Can’t believe my old college that insulated itself from politics, has this moment. Very liberating.”

Kolkata: Hours after police used “minimum force” to ensure BJP supporters did not clash with JU students after the two sides came face-to-face at the Sulekha crossing on Monday evening, cops registered two FIRs against both.

While the first FIR mentions unidentified JU students, the one against BJP named some of its leaders , like former MP and south Kolkata organizational leader Somnath Banerjee. Both cases were registered suo motu by Jadavpur police sub-inspector Chandi Charan Banerjee.

FIR No. 9 dealt with JU protest. “On January 6, at about 10.50 pm, JU students formed an unlawful assembly with lathi and bricks... In spite of repeated orders by police, they blocked the road... They assaulted police by throwing burnt tyres at them...” the FIR stated.

FIR (No. 8) against BJP leaders and supporters is stronger, where it said they attacked cops and even molested woman cops. “On January 6, about 8.45pm, the accused, Somnath Banerjee, Anupam Hazra, Sarbari Ganguly and Arunava—all forming the core BJP leadership—made an unlawful assembly with lathi and other objects at Sulekha... They disobeyed police order, assaulted cops and outraged modesty of woman police...” it stated.

414,['8/01/2020'],Coimbatore gets own suicide prevention helpline,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: A city-based holistic wellness and counselling centre, Nitya Gurukula (NG), has launched its first exclusive suicide prevention helpline called “Prana”. People, who feel suicidal or extremely depressed, could call the toll-free number 1800-121-203040 between 10am and 3pm. The calls will be attended by counsellors at Nitya Gurukula or student volunteers trained by them.

Sudha Sundaram, one of the counsellors, said the helpline will be manned by a team of 15 full-time counsellors and eight volunteers, who are being trained. “Eventually, we will have a team of fully-trained volunteers manning the helpline on their own. While the helpline has been launched, it will work in a full-fledged manner only from February 15.”

Sashi Chandran, managing trustee of Nitya Gurukula Foundation and Charities, got the idea to start the helpline when she was pursuing her PhD on suicides at the Madras University. “That was when she was exposed to the high number of suicides in the country, especially in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Sikkim and West Bengal. We also began getting a lot of student volunteers, who want to help in counselling. So, we decided to launch the helpline,” Sundaram said.

The district had seen 556 suicides in 2018 and 468 in the first nine months of 2019. Psychiatrists in the district have long felt the need of a suicide prevention helpline in the district as in Chennai, which has Sneha and 104. Dr N S Moni, of Balaji Neuro Psychiatric Centre, had earlier told TOI that “the number of people who need such helplines are much higher as a majority of attempts to suicide are not recorded by police.”

According to psychiatrists, a suicide prevention helpline could be successful in stopping a suicide only if it is manned by experienced psychologists. “People usually decide to commit suicide in a moment of agitation. They call a helpline in a second of self-doubt. Often, a good counsellor could bring down the agitation to the extent of them changing their mind. But for this, the counsellor needs to be an experienced psychologist or psychiatrist trained in preventing suicides,” Moni had said.

PUNE: Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) students took out a march on Tuesday evening from the institute’s campus to the Savitribai Phule Pune University in protest against Sunday’s violence at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

Members of various student and youth organizations joined the rally brought out amid heavy police arrangements — from FTII to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). As the FTII students started the march from the institute’s Law College Road campus, hundreds of people joined it along the route.

Besides raising slogans against the attack on the JNU students and teachers by some masked men, the demonstrators carried placards against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that have also been the focal points of protests over most of the past month across the country.

Though the rally was primarily led by students and youth, several senior citizens and some social activists matched steps and walked the entire 4.2km route from FTII to the BR Ambedkar statue on the SPPU campus. The organizers of the march were also taken aback by the size of the rally.

“This is a huge crowd. We never thought so many people would turn up. I think there are more than a thousand here,” an FTII student student said.

The police said the march started with around 700 protesters, but it swelled to a few more hundreds as students from various departments of SPPU joined once the rally entered their campus. For some of them, the rally was a statement in itself against “the prevailing political condition in the city too”.

Sachin Ghodeswar, one of the SPPU students who participated in the rally, said, “Pune city has its MP and many MLAs from the ruling party at the Centre. The same party is also in control of the corporation. It is good to see that politics of dissent are prevalent in this city, unlike what happened at JNU,”

A spontaneous rally started around the Ambedkar statue started with speakers from FTII and SPPU, along with the ones from youth organisations like Naujawan Bharat, rasing their voice against the attack on the JNU students and teachers . Some of them also resorted to songs and poems to express the dissent. A number of JNU alumni had also turned up to demonstrate.

“They (ABVP) had always wanted to damage the JNU campus and terrorise its students, but never had this kind of impunity from the Centre and the Delhi Police. I remember that during the India-Pakistan semi-finals of the 2011 World Cup, the ABVP had tried to beat up some Kashmiri students at JNU. A students’ peaceful march on the campus stopped it all,” said Nikhil Narkar, an academic and professor.

NASHIK: Students of Samyak Vidyarthi Andolan continued their protest for second continuous day on Tuesday for the violence against Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) students.

The protest, which was conducted at the Golf Club Ground and Shalimar, was joined in by close to 40 students with banners and posters. The students stated that they were scared after the violence at one of the biggest varsities of the country and requested the government to assure them of no such action to happen in the state.

Santosh Bhalerao, the district head, Samyak Vidyarthi Andolan, said “The incident that happened at JNU is very unfortunate. All the students are petrified of such acts happening across the country. We want the government and the police authorities to protect the students of the city.”

The organisation had taken prior permission for the protest. After protesting at the Golf Club ground the students moved to the Ambedkar Statue at Shalimar and continued their protest. By 1.30 pm, the students met the district administrative authorities and requested that peace should be maintained in the city.

“We wanted to meet the district administrative officers and express our protest. They have accepted our request and said that they will take our plea to the governor and also to the president soon,” Bhalerao told TOI.

On Monday, the functionaries of the Nationalist Youth Congress protested outside the office of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, who claimed the responsibility of the attacks.

427,['8/01/2020'],Capital dreams likely to hurt city vegetable market,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The proposal to set up the executive capital of the state at Vizag city has farmers worried that fertile land will pass out of their hands for construction work on the capital. The capital construction works pass through their farm lands.

Farmers in villages in Anandapuram and Padmanabham mandals under the Bheemili assembly constituency in Visakhapatnam—Velanki, Girijala, Yenugupalem, Mucharla and Sontyam, among others—have been cultivating vegetables and flowers on around 250 acres and paddy on 200 acres for the past few decades. PA Naidu, a farmer from Anandapuram, said, “If we sell our lands, we will get a one-time sum but will also lose our livelihoods,” adding that real estate agents have started to purchase farm land in the two mandals.

Anandapuram is one of the key suppliers of vegetables and flowers for Vizag. The variety of brinjal grown in Velanki is also popular in the region. K Lokanadham, district secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist), said the executive capital would not promote development of the region or generate employment, but hasten the takeover of farmlands in and around the city. A section of farmers are hopeful that setting up the executive capital here would push up land prices, while others fear loss of livelihood, Lokanadham added.

“On average, each farmer in the Anandapuram and Padmanabham region gets at a profit of at least Rs 50,000 per acre in a year by cultivating vegetables and a profit of Rs 1 lakh per acre for growing flowers,” said P Ramu, a farmer. Most farmers in the region grown tomato, beans, okra and cauliflower.

Members of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), Vizag chapter stated that farmers would sell their lands if realtors offered lucrative prices. The real estate sector on the city’s outskirts and in neighbouring Vizianagaram district would also be given a boost, they said.

The requirement of vegetables in the city stands between 6,000 to 7,000 quintals a day, at present.

If the executive capital is set up here, this requirement will increase over time and the city may face a shortage of supply if farm land in Anandapuram is taken over for real estate projects.

NEW DELHI: Though Delhi court order picked 7am as the time and January 22, 2019 – as the day of hanging of the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya case, these men still have the option of their remaining legal remedies – a curative petition in the Supreme Court and a mercy plea before the President of India.Dr Yug Mohit Chaudhry, an advocate who specialises in death penalty cases, said, “They can file a curative petition. They can file a mercy petition — the most important thing. The government will consider it in all sincerity and not rubber stamp its rejection.”Chaudhry also highlighted that legal remedy has to be considered seriously. “This is one of the most solemn powers of the Constitution — the power of life and death exercised by the state. They have the power to give clemency. They should exercise their powers independently and mercifully,” he added.The four convicts in the Nirbhaya case have been ordered to be hanged in Jail at 7am on January 22. A trial court had on September 10, 2013, convicted Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan of 13 offences, including gang rape, unnatural offence and murder of the woman and attempt to murder her male friend. Three days later, it had awarded death to all four convicts and referred the case to Delhi high court for confirmation of death sentence.Advocate AT Ansari was a part of the trial of the Nirbhaya case as a prosecutor. He felt satisfied that justice had prevailed finally. He was concerned that despite the rising number of convictions in rape cases, such crime hadn’t seen a downturn.Recalling the days of trial, Ansari was proud of the team led by senior lawyer Dayan Krishnan, who did not leave any stone unturned in assisting the court. Ansari remembered one such instance during the trial when during the examination of one of the prosecution witnesses, an issue of improper administering of oath was raised. “The portion of his already recorded statement was discarded by the prosecution. The oath was administered again, so was his deposition,” he said.The trial saw the prosecution relying amply on scientific evidence. The case also stood out for having utilised the technology of forensic odontology for the first time in India. “It was used to establish the traces of bite of marks found on the victim's body to prove that it had been caused by the accused persons,” added Ansari.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73147535,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-586388,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-over-for-four-convicts-not-quite/articleshow/73146543.cms

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The members of Nilgiri Potato and Vegetable Growers’ Association (NPVGA) on Tuesday took out a rally in Ooty to protest the district administration’s bid to ban pesticides and weedicides bearing ‘red’ and ‘yellow’ labels as part of its drive to go fully organic. They also submitted a memorandum to collector J Innocent Divya.

Earlier, the district administration and the horticulture department had in a draft circular unveiled it plans to ban the pesticides and weedicides containing highly toxic components, which are denoted by ‘red’ and ‘yellow’ labels, by March 2020 considering the health of soil and fragile environment system prevailing in the hills. The circular was based on Section 43 of the Insecticides Act, 1968.

Opposing the move, around 2,000 people from various walks of life on Tuesday took out the rally that was supported by Ooty English Vegetables Merchants’ Association, Ooty Lorry Owners’ Association and Traders of Pesticides and Weedicides Association. They marched to the district collectorate from Ooty main bus stand.

Stating that agriculture would collapse in the district if pesticides were to be banned, C Gopal, joint secretary, NPVGA said, “We have submitted a memorandum to the collector opposing the decision to ban pesticides and weedicides. Let the government first experiment organic farming in its farms. If they become successful, they can implement it in the district gradually.”

The collector, meanwhile, said they had asked the members of NPVGA to produce a list of pesticides and weedicides that they wanted to use. “The list will be sent to the agricultural university for lab test. A draft circular regarding the ban has been sent to all the panchayats in the district. After receiving their resolutions, a proposal in this regard will be sent to the government for further action,” she said.

According to Innocent Divya, training in organic farming will be provided to farmers.

430,['8/01/2020'],Delhi FIRs against Aishe Ghosh ‘victim-bashing’,"This story is from January 8, 2020

JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh

KOLKATA: Two FIRs filed against JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh , whose bloodied face after an attack by alleged masked intruders on JNU campus triggered nationwide protest since Sunday, has outraged Kolkata.

“This is shocking. It is shameful to lodge an FIR against Aishe,” said Sougata Bhaduri, a JNU English professor and a Bagmari resident, who was also assaulted at JNU on Sunday night. Patuli resident Mousumi Mandal, who is doing her PhD at JNU, said she found it baffling that the police were so prompt in registering FIRs against Aishe but yet to arrest, or even identify, any of the attackers. “We no longer feel safe on the campus. Instead of making us feel safe by arresting the goons, cops are now indulging in victim bashing. We will not sit back if anything happens to Aishe,” Mandal said.

Senior criminal lawyer Milon Mukherjee said the police move had left him puzzled. “On one hand, the Delhi Police aid they were not alerted, indicating they were absent from the campus. Yet, they lodged an FIR,” he said. Criminal lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee felt when the FIR was questionable, a possible recourse was to immediately move the high court to quash it.

Similar sentiments resonated on the Kolkata streets on Tuesday. IIT Kharagpur research scholar Debjani Roy, who was part of the JNU alumni association protest meet in the city, said, “This government is quick to take action against the victim herself. This shows their real intentions.” Jhelum Roy, a JU PhD scholar, said, “If Aishe is arrested or anything happens to her, we will mobilise our protests further.”

Sambuddha Tarafdar, who is pursuing his PhD at JU, has even launched a “I support Aishe” campaign on social media that garnered support from 62 people within a couple of hours. Kolkatans also vowed their support on Aishe’s Facebook page. “Comrade, all sensible people are beside you. Red salute to you and to other comrade,” wrote Samir Dutta Gupta, who retired as an academic sections officer from Asiatic Society. Arnab Ganguly, former Presidency student and now studying at ISI Delhi, sarcastically posted that it (FIRs) would mean Aishe had taken a steel rod and hit her own head to get injured.

Criminal lawyer Chatterjee, who has argued against several false FIRs, said, “Once an FIR is lodged against Aishe, it will have to be taken to legal closure. Even if she, or those who were with her that night, were to lodge a counter complaint, this FIR will stand. The option other than moving a quashing petition in the high court is to seek an anticipatory bail and help cops with evidence to prove her innocence. But given the police’s haste in lodging an FIR against her, I am not sure whether that would be the correct path or not.”

Telangana State Youth Congress spokesperson SP Kranthi Kumar said there is a strong suspicion that ABVP is allegedly behind the attack. “How can masked miscreants enter the university and beat up students, without any plan and backing by some organisation. A judiciary inquiry should be done,” he said.

Telangana Jana Samithi founder-president M Kodandaram termed the attack as undemocratic and uncivilised. “The video clips circulated on social media and flashed on news channels clearly showed masked men launching an attack and injuring the students. This issue has to be dealt with all seriousness and culprits should be booked. Whoever is behind this attack should be exposed,” Kodandaram said and also condemned the attack on Swaraj Abhiyan chief Yogendra Yadav.

AICC secretary V Hanumantha Rao questioned what was the police intelligence wing doing? They would have got some tip prior to the attack. It seems to be handiwork of right-wing organisations, he alleged.

Visakhapatnam: With the state government exploring its option of setting up an executive capital in the city, demand for real estate is likely to go up.

In the last one and half decade, roughly 35,000 acre arable land in the outskirts of the city was turned into housing plots. But a host of issues, including agitation for the bifurcation of the state, had dampened the demand. According to sources, these layouts and plots are now coming under the real estate radar. With the capital proposal, another 20,000 acre farmland would be converted into layouts very soon, said S Naidu, a man dealing in real estate.

“It is inevitable since the capital would give a boost to business. The sales would be on Vizianagaram and Srikakulam routes from Ananadapuram. There were layouts in a few areas on those stretches up to Poosapatirega, Bhogapuram, and Ranastalam,” he pointed out.

In the last 15 years, 13 mandals surrounding the city and a few close to the seashore in the district have lost more than 60,000 acre farmland to real estate and industries from Atyutapuram, Anakapalli to Anandapuram, Pendurthi, Sabbavaram and other areas.

85% of cultivable lands at Parawada, Sabbavaram, Vepagunta, Pendurthi, Purushottampuram, Chinnamushidiwada, Madhurawada, Kommadi, Paradesipalem, Tagarpuvalasa, Anandapuram, Padmanabham and Bheemili were converted into layouts, and apartments. New colonies, too, have come up in these locations on the outskirts of the city.

The city is expanding towards Vizianagaram and Srikakulam route.

Visakhapatnam: At a time when the state government is fast moving towards making Vizag the executive capital, the de facto seat of power, Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) is likely to emerge as the new unofficial CRDA (Capital Region Development Authority). There are enough hints from the state government to locate the secretariat, chief minister’s office and other key offices in the city.

Considering the anticipated development potential of the city as the executive capital, the region warrants meticulous urban planning or for that matter, a robust urban developmental authority to assist the state government towards achieving the desired results. The UDA must address zoning regulations, industrial development plans, service plans, environmental sustainability, public amenity plans, land use plans, policy framework, housing policies, transportation and mobility requirements, resource conservation plans, disaster management strategies etc. Here VMRDA comes in handy for the state government as the high power body for urban planning and development in its jurisdiction of three north coastal districts by virtue of the powers bestowed on it as per VMRDA Act.

Welcoming the three capital proposal, VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivas said that the VMRDA is poised to play a key role in the future development of the region if Vizag indeed becomes the executive capital, in association with other line departments such as GVMC, district administration and others. “We are in the midst of preparing the master plan-2041 and perspective plan-2051 in consultation with key stakeholders and public of the region.

The plans will provide the vision for the development area, policy framework and directions of growth and identification of the thrust areas for development in each district in VMRDA’s jurisdiction. The perspective plan and development strategy are being prepared after analysing the existing issues, opportunities, infrastructure, socio-economics, physical constraints, development vision, etc. in line with the developmental policies of the state government,” said Srinivas to ToI. Srinivas further added that Vizag, being the only cosmopolitan city in the bifurcated Andhra Pradesh, already emerged as the financial capital, IT and tourism hub, fintech valley, health city, manufacturing/industrial hub, education hub, etc. “Having a coastline and best connectivity to all parts of the state, Vizag meets all the criteria to be the capital of the state,” said Srinivas.

SLUG: Godavari River Pollution

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has provided a list of 61 industrial units — allegedly discharging waste without treating them into various nullahs linked to river Godavari — to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ).

These units are located in Satpur and Ambad industrial estates of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC).

An MPCB official said teams would now visit these units and carry out spot assessment before taking action against them.

Recently, chairman of the high-powered committee and Nashik divisional commissioner Rajaram Mane had directed the agencies to take action against those responsible for polluting Godavari. The committee was formed on instructions of the Bombay high court.

“We recently served notices to eight industrial units causing pollution. Of these eight, seven were given show-cause notices and a closure notice was issued to one unit. The seven units were asked to comply with the norms while the last unit has been shut down,” the official said.

“We will again visit the industrial areas to ensure that industries are not releasing effluents directly into the nullahs or causing river pollution. Action would be taken against units found flouting the norms,” he added.

The NMC has already informed the MPCB about the industrial units releasing effluents into the nullahs that connects to Godavari river.

According to NMC, 61 industrial units in Satpur and Ambad industrial areas are directly releasing effluents into eight nullahs. These nullahs are connected to Godavari river.

“Action should be taken against industries releasing untreated effluents into the nullahs. But at the same time government should also provide infrastructures like underground drainage lines and common effluent treatment plant (CETP) in industrial areas,” Tushar Chavan, secretary of Nashik Industries & Manufacturers Association (NIMA), said.

“Metal units have proposed CETP in Ambad industrial areas and have also given contribution, but the state government is yet to release funds for the project and this is causing delay to the project,” he added.

“Instead of giving mere notices, the MPCB should take closure action against industrial units causing pollution in Godavari,” Rajesh Pandit, environmentalist and petitioner of PIL on Godavari pollution in Bombay High Court, said.

441,['8/01/2020'],Decision taken on wrong data which shows no Anglo Indian in Uttrakhand: Nominated MLA,"This story is from January 8, 2020

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand state assembly on Tuesday ratified the 126th constitution amendment bill to extend SC/ST — excluding Anglo Indians — quota in state assemblies and Lok Sabha by another 10 years.

Meanwhile, the lone nominated Anglo Indian member in the state assembly George Ivan Gregory Mann, who is likely to complete his tenure as legislator in Dehradun , termed it “unfortunate” and said that the decision was taken on wrong data.

Speaking the TOI, Mann said that he was deeply saddened by the legislature exclusion of the Anglo Indian community. “I had not expected this and I hope that the party would review its decision for the benefit of the Anglo Indian community.” On being asked about the justification of having an Anglo Indian a colonial relic, Mann said, “Don’t call it colonial. Anglo Indians were born in India, it is our motherland. The reservation of our representation in the state assemblies and Lok Sabha is a constitutional provision.”

Mann expressed his surprise over the fact that the census mentioned that there was no Anglo Indian in Dehradun or Uttarakhand. “I want to tell the House that there are 16 Anglo Indian schools in Uttarakhand, which are working for the development and economy of the state,” he said.

He added that the constitution had provided them a special security cover, which has been now been withdrawn. “Since Independence there is no doubting of our contribution towards the society and the country. We are known for honesty, sacrifice and hard work. We do not belong to any particular region but the entire nation is ours.”

He added that the numbers of Anglo Indians in Dehradun alone is over 110. “The definition of Anglo Indian is very clear and it follows the father’s side of lineage. We were given the reservation for the contribution in development of the country and it has nothing to do with our faith,” Mann said. He claimed to take up the issue of doing away of Anglo India reservation with national leadership in Delhi.

Mann is the third Anglo Indian MLA in Uttarakhand, before him RV Gardner who was nominated twice (first in 2002 and second in 2012) and Karen Meyer Hilton who held the position in 2007.

He added that many Anglo Indians are living below the poverty line and needs a voice to bring forward their issues. “Our PM had given the slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and following the principles of unity in diversity, I would like to request our CM and the assembly to reconsider the decision.”

Meanwhile, in the state assembly, within minutes of the bill being ratified, the BJP camp hailed the decision but kept silent on the need of doing away the reservation to Anglo Indian. BJP state president and Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt said, “The decision about the extension for the reservation of Anglo Indians would be considered at a later stage by the government. Our government is committed to giving all reservation facilities to SC/ST envisioned by the constitution.” Bhatt, however, added that the country has only 500 people from the Anglo Indian community which he considered too small to be given reservation under the 126th amendment.

Shop closed during Bandh (File Photo)

BHUBANESWAR: Several government and private schools in the city have declared a holiday on Wednesday on account of the ‘ Bharat bandh ’ called by trade unions.

Apprehending trouble, collectors of Khurda (of which Bhubaneswar is a part), Ganjam, Kandhamal and Dhenkanal have declared closure of all schools (both government and private) in their respective districts. The Utkal University , too, has postponed semester examinations scheduled for the day.

The Odisha Private Bus Owners’ Association has not declared support to the bandh. Sources said private buses would, however, largely remain off the roads. “Our decision on whether to ply the buses will depend on an assessment of the situation on Wednesday morning. One must understand that damages incurred during a bandh are not reimbursed by insurance companies,” association secretary Debendra Sahoo said.

Though BJD has neither supported nor opposed the bandh, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Ranendra Pratap Swain said, “We support the cause of the bandh because of rising unemployment, the economic situation in the country and the plight of farmers and workers.” He later clarified that he had made the statement in his capacity as the working president of Hind Mazdoor Sabha and that his view did not reflect the party’s.

The government has asked the district collectors ‘to take all preventive measures to maintain law and order and ensure maintenance of essential services.’ Special secretary (home) Santosh Bala wrote to the collectors to ask employees ‘to attend office by 9.30 am’.

In Bhubaneswar, police said elaborate arrangements would be in place to ensure people were not inconvenienced. “We will ensure that the national highway is not blocked, trains are not stopped, schools and government offices are not disturbed,” DCP Anup Sahoo said.

S K Majhi, Utkal University’s controller of examinations, said semester examinations were suspended as examinees might find it difficult to reach on venue on time. The National Testing Agency (NTA) is yet to issue any notice on the JEE Main exam that is also scheduled for Wednesday.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation , which supplies mid-day meals (MDM) to schools in five districts (Khurda, Puri, Cuttack, Sundargarh and Nayagarh) from its centralised kitchens, has decided not to supply meals on Wednesday. The foundation has informed the state nodal officer of the MDM of its decision.

Citu leader Janardan Pati said hospitals, medicine shops, milk vans and examinees would not be disturbed during the bandh. In the western Odisha town of Bargarh, where the annual Dhanu Yatra is under way, the trade unionists have decided against closing shops and business establishments or stopping vehicles.

Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni has decided to tackle the issue of water theft in the city and has asked citizens to inform him if they know of any such case. He said immediate action would be taken if he received a complaint or information in this regard.

The mayor’s decision comes after some corporators complained to him about water theft in their wards. The mayor has directed the officials concerned to look into the issue.

“Bringing water theft cases under control will be on the top of my agenda during the ‘Visit to ward’ project beginning this Saturday,” said Kulkarni. “I will immediately take action against those involved in water theft, he told TOI.

“Apart from listening to the grievances of the residents, I will also hold meetings with all four coporators of the ward during my visit to discuss their issues and problems,” he added.

The total water pipeline network in the city is 2,100km-long. At present, the non-revenue water (NRW) losses are 40% of the total supply. NRW losses are because of water leakage and water theft.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has set a water tax collection target of 65.42 crore for the current financial year (2019-20), but NMC has only managed to collect Rs 37 crore. The civic body will have to collect 50% more water tax to achieve the target set for the current financial year, an NMC official said.

In the financial year 2018-19, the NMC had collected water tax of Rs 45 crore and in 2017-18 it had collected Rs 29.50 crore.

The NMC collects property and water taxes through the Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Satpur, Panchavati and Cidco division offices.

In all, there are 1.96 lakh water connections, 1.87 lakh of them residential, 4,000 commercial and the rest non-commercial.

446,['8/01/2020'],"Delhi assembly elections: Work gained pace as shackles broken, says Arvind Kejriwal","This story is from January 8, 2020

Arvind Kejriwal at Central Park in New Delhi on Tuesday

NEW DELHI: At the last of his seven town halls on Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal denied Delhi BJP’s allegations that he had worked only in the last six months . The work has speeded up after the Supreme Court order on the Centre-versus-Delhi power tussle gave more power to the AAP government, he said.

A day after the election schedule for the assembly elections was announced, Kejriwal attacked BJP’s premise of the triple-engine government in Delhi. “BJP is running the state and the municipal governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, but schools, hospitals, roads are in bad shape there and electricity is costly,” Kejriwal said at Connaught Place’s Central Park. The honest intention, not triple engine, helps in the development of the state, he added.

Condemning Sunday’s attack in JNU, Kejriwal said all steps should be taken to check violence on the campus. Police can handle the situation, but they get adverse orders from their bosses, he alleged. “I can change the situation within a month if we get Delhi Police under my control,” he said.

In the wake of the death warrants for the Nirbhaya convicts, the CM highlighted his government’s work for women’s safety. “My government is always serious about women’s safety, but all sections of the society should join hands for it,” he said, adding the installation of 1.5 lakh CCTV cameras were working as a deterrent. “We will not leave any dark spot in Delhi.” Accepting that Delhi lacks the last-mile connectivity, he added that his government was working on it.

On AAP’s association with political strategist Prashant Kishor, the party’s national convener said all good people should come and join good politics. His biggest weakness, Kejriwal said, is not knowing politics.

Kejriwal said the AAP government did not implement the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat Yojna as Delhi’s scheme was better. On slow progress of some projects, Kejriwal said 500 Wi-Fi hotspots were being added every week and 800 mohalla clinics would be opened within three months. “Before the Supreme Court verdict, all files were required to be sent to the LG and he sat on them,” he alleged.

Kejriwal rubbished BJP’s repeated allegations that Delhi government was starving the municipal corporations of funds. Despite the AAP government giving “three times more funds” than earlier, why the corporations can’t distribute salaries now, he wondered.

The government, the CM said, will decide on the prosecution sanction of former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar and others after consulting legal experts.

He also said that the Centre should work with all CMs to find a solution for the economic condition.

447,['8/01/2020'],56 coaching instts get final notice over fire safety,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC )’s fire brigade department has served final notices to 56 coaching classes for not complying with the fire safety norms, the penalty for which will be snapping of water and power supply lines.

So far, 263 coaching classes have complied with the fire safety norms thus taking the total tally of 319 classes falling in the jurisdiction of the NMC.

The move comes on the backdrop of the tragic incident at a tutorial in Surat in which 18 students lost their lives in May last year.

In an effort to avoid such incidents from taking place, the NMC started a survey in May itself but as the classes were on leave for two months the total number of classes was unknown. Moreover, the scarcity of manpower also delayed the survey of tutorials in the city. The fire brigade department deployed a team of six people to conduct the survey as it was finally completed in August.

In December, the NMC had served notices to over 263 classes for not installing the fire equipment in their premises. Out of which 216 classes fulfilled the fire norms compliance, but remaining 47 failed to comply with the fire norms.

“After the notices were issued twice in the past six months, around 263 coaching classes installed all necessary fire safety equipment, complying with the fire norms. Now, we have slapped final notices to remaining coaching classes for not complying with the fire norms. We have warned them of disconnecting water and power connections if they do not fulfill the norms,” said NMC officials.

Jayant Mule, president, Nashik District Private Coaching Classes Directors’ Association said that the remaining 56 units have also installed fire safety norms, but they could not submit building completion and fire audit documents of the building. “NMC wants fire audit of the whole building, but we have sought the fire brigade department to consider the audit of the portion of the building used for coaching classes,” said Mule.

He said that they want NMC to relax some conditions or increase the time-frame to comply with the fire norms. “We recently met both municipal commissioner and the city mayor, seeking relaxation in certain conditions. We are waiting for a positive decision by the NMC for relaxing conditions of the fire norms,” added Mule.

PUNE: The Lonavla police on Tuesday claimed to have detected the murder of Resham Purushottam Bansal/Agarwal (70) in her flat with the arrest of a former employee at her husband’s grocery shop and his two accomplices.

A police team led by inspector B R Patil took the suspects — Ashokumar Sargara (20), the former employee at the shop of the victim’s husband, Jagadishkumar Jodaji (22) and Pintu Parmar (19) — into custody from Rajasthan . Sargara had hatched the plot of robbery and executed it with the help of Jodaji. The police have recovered cash and gold ornaments collectively worth Rs83,700 from the duo. Parwar was them in Rajasthan.

“After throttling Resham to death, the duo had robbed cash and silver coins collectively worth Rs2.82 lakh from her flat at Dwarkami society and fled. They were hiding in a temple on a hillock in Rajasthan,” Patil said.

Patil said while working in the grocery shop of Purushottam Agarwal — the husband of the victim, Sargara came to know that there was always a good amount of cash at his house. After working for about six months, Sargara left the job and started working as cook in a sweet shop in Lonavla.

On January 2, Sargara and Jodaji went to the victim’s flat and rang the doorbell. When Resham opened the door, they told her they had an half-empty LPG cylinder and if she needed it. “As Resham knew them, she allowed them inside. The duo throttled her to death and robbed the valuables,” Patil said.

Principal Fr Dominic Savio announces the college’s future plans.

KOLKATA: Officials at St Xavier’s College , Kolkata (autonomous) are planning to introduce admission tests in several humanities subjects from the next academic session. Principal Fr Dominic Savio said they are considering a plan to take students after the second round of screening, instead of offering admissions on the basis of Class-XII board marks.

“With high marks being awarded to students, some candidates, despite scoring 97% in the aggregate, fail to get seats in the humanities departments like English, economics, sociology and political science among others. So, we may conduct admission tests for some of the humanities subjects,” said Savio.

The principal, however, agreed that the college would face logistics problems while conducting the admission tests for 6,000 to 7,000 applicants in each subject.

“We have more than 13,000 applicants for BCom Honours. So, the tests, if held, will go on for long,” said Savio. This year the college received 23,000 applications for 2,300 undergraduate seats.

However, the criteria for selection and weightage on Plus-Two marks and admission tests will be decided later. The college authorities are also planning to increase seats for subjects like political science, economics, sociology, English, physics and mathematics, so that more students can fulfil their dreams of being Xaverians. “We may add five more seats to the subjects that are in high demand. Usually, we take 55-60 students in each subject,” said the principal.

Meanwhile, the 13th convocation and valedictory ceremony of St Xavier’s College will be held on January 16 to mark the 160th Foundation Day of the institution. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has been invited to grace the event as chief guest who will deliver the convocation address. Ashis Banerjee, former vice-chancellor, Calcutta University will be awarded the Nihil Ultra Award at the convocation.

The college authorities have also decided to come up with a health and wellness centre on its main campus on Park Street. “We are going to set up a centre where students can maintain fitness. Apart from indoor and outdoor games where all students can participate, this arrangement will give opportunities to our students to go for fitness practice. There will also be lectures on good lifestyle, including spirituality,” said Savio. The construction of a meditation centre is also in the pipeline.

Kochi: A team of structural engineers from Kerala , assigned by Maradu municipality’s technical panel, will do rapid visual screening of structures situated close to the apartment complexes within minutes of demolition on Saturday and Sunday. The procedure involves visual evaluation of structures, potential vulnerability and ascertaining whether they are strong enough for people to inhabit.

Engineers, along with fire tenders, will enter the exclusion zone (200m radius) soon after the fourth siren is given. They will examine houses for cracks (possible due to impact of blasting) and how dangerous they are to the structure. Later, they will send an assessment to control room. The administration will allow residents, who were shifted to safer places before demolition, to return home based on the report.

Holy Faith will be demolished at 11am and Alfa Serene at 11.05am on January 11. Both structures come under a single, exclusion zone. “Alfa Serene will be demolished only after the demolition company of Holy Faith H2O gives a go-ahead signal. When a building is demolished there will be cloud dust in the air. Edifice team will enter the site and examine it. when the cloud subsides, fire tenders along with structural engineers will enter the area and do rapid visual screening. If everything is OK, they will pass instruction to the control room. Then only clearance for demolition of Alfa Serene will be given since demolition experts need visibility to implode the structure,” said a source

The process of inspection will take 5-30 minutes. But the process is not going to affect our schedule since the area will be declared as a no-flying zone, added the source.

Meanwhile on Monday, filling of explosives started at Alfa Serene and around 400kg of explosives were filled in the holes drilled in the two towers.

KOLKATA: Unrest in the city resulting in clogged roads seems to be increasing the number of passengers travelling by Metro .

On Monday, after students brought out rallies from the Jadavpur University and Presidency University against the violence at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ), people seem to have gone ‘underground’ to travel longer distances by opting for the Metro, instead of road transport. No wonder, Metro Railway’s earnings shot up to over Rs 1 crore — the third highest since its inception in 1984.

During the day Metro carried 6.48 lakh passengers. This is quite normal for a weekday. The additional revenue indicates that many passengers travelled longer distances by Metro.

“On Monday, Metro earned Rs 100.8 lakh. The recorded highest earnings till now are Rs 147.8 lakh on August 1, 2011 when the new smart cards were introduced and Rs 129.7 lakh on November 9, 2016,” said Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee.

C Santhanam, a Palamedu resident, stated in his petition that there were representatives of all communities except the parayar community in the Grama Podhu Mahalinga Swamy Madathu committee, the jallikattu organising committee.

In fact, when the members of the organising committee decided to conduct the bull taming event on January 16, his community’s plea to include its representative was rejected. Santhanam stated that this was discrimination under Articles 14 and 17 of the Constitution which deal with abolition of untouchability. Hence he moved the high court seeking a direction to convene a peace meeting to include the parayar community in the jallikattu committee this year as well as in the years to come. When the petition was heard on Tuesday, a division bench of M Duraiswamy and T Ravindran directed the state government to file a counter in this regard within four weeks. The judges also directed the Madurai district collector and police officials to ensure the smooth conduct of the jallikattu at Palamedu on January 16.

454,['8/01/2020'],No sentence review board meet since Oct: Plea in HC,"This story is from January 8, 2020

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the AAP government’s stand on a plea alleging that meetings of Sentence Review Board (SRB) were not held every quarter despite court’s directions.

Justice A K Chawla asked the government’s home department, SRB and the prison authority to file a status report in response to the petition that has sought contempt action against them for alleged non-compliance with high court’s direction to hold meetings as per the Delhi Prison Rules 2018.

The plea by Amit Sahni, a lawyer and an activist, has claimed that according to the Delhi Prison Rules 2018, SRB meetings have to be held every quarter. He contended that the high court on October 21 last year had directed that SRB meetings be held in accordance with the prison rules.

The plea alleged that ever since the October order, not a single meeting was held till date. Arguing that it amounts to “willful disobedience” of judicial orders, the plea sought contempt action against the officials concerned, including AAP MLA Satyendar Jain, the chairman of the board.

As per the contempt plea, the SRB chairperson has the power to hold meetings more frequently than just every quarter, but Jain failed to do so. The court said it would take up the matter on May 5.

TRICHY: A 35-year-old man was hacked to death by a three-member gang near Thiruverumbur on the outskirts of Trichy on Monday.

The victim has been identified as D Rajasekaran, a grocery shop owner from VS Colony in Kattur.

According to a complaint filed by Rajasekaran’s father A Devadoss, 62, two of the accused M Gopal and M Mesack from Annan Nagar in South Kattur had a dispute with the victim for a long time.

On Monday, Rajasekaran saw the duo taking bath in a drinking water pipeline in the area and asked them to leave. This led to a verbal duel between them.

The duo left the place and returned with some sharp weapons. They barged into the house where Rajasekaran was running a grocery shop. They launched an indiscriminate attack on Rajasekaran, his father and mother.

While Devadoss and his wife escaped with injuries, the gang hacked Rajasekaran with a sword. He sustained injuries on his head, left ear, right shoulder and left hand and died on the spot. The gang then fled the scene.

On getting the information, the Thiruverumbur police rushed to the spot.

Police shifted the body to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital for postmortem, which was performed on Tuesday.

Preliminary inquiry revealed the role of a third accused in the murder, who is yet to be identified. Police have registered a case of murder, trespass and criminal intimidation against the three.

The Thiruverumbur police on Tuesday evening, said that the accused are yet to be arrested.

456,['8/01/2020'],Dialogue not VC’s cup of tea: JNU community,"M Jagadesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: Among staff and teachers at Jawaharlal Nehru University, M Jagadesh Kumar is gaining a reputation as the institution’s “most unpopular” vice-chancellor. Indeed ever since he took over in January 2016, he has got embroiled in one controversy after another. Some of his decisions are seen as reflective of a certain political ideology, but even those who assess him without such considerations assert that Kumar has shut every door of dialogue and debate on the campus, taken undemocratic decisions and administered the university on whims.Not surprisingly, the JNU campus under Kumar is as polarised as the society outside it. Against those who want him urgently removed at university head, there also are teachers and students who admit he may “sometimes take unsustainable, hasty decisions” but believe he is only “a victim of a political agenda”.Just a month into office, Kumar found the university wracked by the sedition case and accusations of anti-national activities. Eight months later, Najeeb Ahmed disappeared from the campus, creating another hullaballoo. Amid other simmering issues, such as a decrease in MPhil and PhD positions, proscribing protests near the administrative block and making class attendance mandatory, he provoked outrage by deciding the students’ union leadership elected in 2019 could not be notified. And then, the violence on the campus this past week was the fallout of his unwillingness to talk to students about their demand for a rollback of hiked hostel fees. Many have pinpointed the unpopularity of Kumar, a professor of electrical engineering, to his being averse to meeting and discussing problems with the stakeholders.Sourabh Wade, a PhD scholar, cited occasions when Kumar proved “arrogant, probably because of the central government’s backing”. He said, “The vice-chancellor overlooked the Academic Council on issues like the fee hike and compulsory attendance. In fact, the Executive Council meeting discussing the hostel fee hike had to be held 18km outside the campus. The Inter Hall Administration meeting was convened with the hostel presidents being informed only 30 minutes before it. By the time, they reached the IHA, the new manual with hiked fees was signed. There is a series of such undemocratic decisions in the past four years.”Perhaps because of their own political affiliations and Kumar’s perceived closeness to the ruling regime at the Centre, the teachers aren’t happy, as indicated by the fulminations of professor D K Lobiyal, president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association. “He is arrogant, an egoist. He thinks he is the power centre and everybody else is inferior,” Lobiyal said. “He hardly engages in dialogue and whenever he does, he isn’t above insulting the participants.” He added that a university system had to run in collaboration with teachers and students, but under Kumar JNUTA wasn’t invited for deliberations and dialogues.Protests over various disagreements led the teachers to go on day’s strike on July 31 in 2018, but this drew stinging reprisal, with Kumar issuing notices to 48 of them. According to Lobiyal, in a JNU Teachers’ Association referendum on August 7 that year, only eight teachers thought he should continue as vice-chancellor while 279 teachers wanted him out.However, there are some who think he is targeted for everything so he eventually “flees”. Hari Ram Mishra, professor in the School of Sanskrit and Indic Studies, said, “His unpopularity is an erroneous perception. When anti-national slogans were raised in the university soon after he joined as VC , he was very firm that the culprits should be punished. Only his being new meant he did not handle the situation in a better way. Political leaders of opposition parties joined the Left with the agenda to frustrate him by opposing his every move.” Mishra, however, agreed that Kumar took “hasty decisions” sometimes, like on the attendance issue or the hostel fee hike.But even teachers with no political leanings find it hard to accept Kumar’s tenure, believing that he has disturbed the time-tested ways of the varsity by assuming full power and rendering the centres and schools dysfunctional.“For 50 years, all academic decisions were taken the centres. Only if there was a problem would it be broached at the Board of Studies. Any problem being resolved out of the centre was a shame for us,” said a senior teacher in the Centre of French Studies. “All this changed in the past few years. There was, for example, the convention of appointing senior faculty as the dean, but now young colleagues too are appointed to that position. The whole JNU system got disturbed from the day this gentleman took over.”Kumar’s actions are perceived through a political prism, so much so that when eminent historian Romila Thapar was asked, in September 2019, to submit her CV to allow the university to determine her continuance as professor emerita, it was immediately taken to be a fallout of Thapar being a strong critic of the Centre.Yet even members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student organisation affiliated to RSS, the Hindu body that Kumar is often accused of being associated with, frequently criticise the VC. Radhakrishnan Yadav, said, “We in ABVP are vexed with him about many issues. His biggest problem is his reluctance to have a dialogue with students. This makes it difficult for us to approach him for help or to discuss campus-related issues.”The torrid time the institution has seen on Kumar’s watch leads to easy comparisons. “I joined JNU in 2015 when the vice-chancellor was Sopory sir (professor S K Sopory),” said Wade. “There was a certain democratic culture then. To the pleasant surprise of the students, Sopory sir once even joined the protesters. In contrast, this new VC wants to run JNU as a technocratic institution.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73147528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-465684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dialogue-not-vcs-cup-of-tea-jnu-community/articleshow/73146567.cms

458,['8/01/2020'],Potato bites as prices continue to mount,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Soaring potato prices have become a major cause of concern for people across Odisha as its price has increased by Rs 5 in the last two days. Potato is now selling at Rs 35 a kg compared to Rs 30 on Sunday and was Rs 20 a kg, a week ago. Unseasonal rain, harsh winter and short supply are the main reasons for the sharp rise in potato prices in the state.

Blaming the state government for the crisis, cold storage owners alleged that since most cold storages have become sick or closed down operations, there is no potato in stock to be used during such crisis.

“Cold storages play a vital role in making the state self-sufficient in potato and potato seed production. Twenty-three cold storages were set up after 2015 under the Potato Mission. But the mission failed and made these units sick. Despite adequate storage potential, consumers are forced to pay high price for potato,” said Janardan Sahoo, secretary of Odisha Cold Storage Association.

Odisha requires around 12 lakh MT of potato every year while the annual production in the state is around two lakh MT a year. The state depends upon West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and north-eastern states to meet its potato need. The short supply from these states led to the price rise.

Every year the unprecedented rise of potato prices disturbs the kitchen budget. “Government wasted so much money on the potato mission. Price rise continues to haunt people every year,” said Antaryami Panda, a bank officer.

459,['8/01/2020'],‘Struggled to find water’: Bandh strands 2k tourists,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The two-day bandh in Visakhapatnam agency evoked good response from tribals, but has put some 2,000 odd tourists at Araku in a bit of a fix.

The bandh call given by tribals under the banner of Girijana Joint Action Committee (JAC) concluded on Tuesday. The protesters demanded strict implementation of AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation Act 1959 (Amendment 1/1970), (LTR 1/70).

Among those who got caught in the strike unwittingly were a group of students from Telangana on a pleasure trip. When TOI ran into the Siddhartha High School team at Simhachalam temple, they said they couldn’t just turn back and leave as several roads had been blocked with boulders.

The Class X students had arrived in Visakhapatnam on January 4 for an excursion and stayed at a lodge named Saptagiri at Simhachalam. Teachers B Srinivas Reddy and P Madhukar who were shepherding the students said they arrived at the picturesque Araku Valley on January 6 in a bus.

“We were shocked to see that the roads were blocked with lorries and boulders. All shops in Araku were closed too,” said Srinivas Reddy.

“We were not aware of the bandh before we started to Araku. We struggled to find water to drink because of the strike. This has been a bitter experience for us,” Madhukar said.

Sai Madhav, among the students, said they were all thrilled to see Araku, only to be let down by shut shops and blocked roads in the tourist spot.

On a different note, when asked about Vizag’s possible emergence as executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, Srinivas Reddy said Vizag deserves the status as it has “all qualities to become executive state capital”.

“In particular, Vizag is best place for tourists and visitors as it has a lot of tourism spots and beautiful weather,” Reddy said.

Girijana JAC had called for the strike to protest against the unlawful leasing of mining land to non-tribal persons in scheduled areas.

CPM party leader Killo Surendra said “We will chalk out our action plan soon. We will resume our agitation soon if the state government fails to consider our demand seriously.”

The tourist department said nearly 2,000 tourists may have visited Araku on Sunday and would return by Monday. With the shutdown of Araku and other places from Monday morning, the tourists were hit.

Cuttack/Kendrapada: Good news for Athagarh Forest Division as well as bird lovers as the number of winged guests has increased by 5,152 this year in the division compared to previous year. This year a total of 21,824 birds have been spotted in comparison to 16,672 last year, informed an Athagarh forest division official.

This year, 11,8326 migratory birds of 105 species have arrived in Bhitarkanika National Park compared to 10,9059 birds that arrived last year, according to the bird census conducted by the the forest department on Monday.

The bird census was conducted by the Athagarh forest division in various waterbodies and Mahanadi on Monday. The Mahanadi is playing host to 4,816 migratory birds. “The census was conducted in all five ranges of Athagarh Forest Division — Athagarh Range, Khuntuni Range, Badamba Range, Narasinghpur East Range and Narasinghpur West Range,” informed Sashmita Lenka, DFO, Athagarh.

Good weather and availability of ample food are the major reasons for the increase in number of birds this year, said Lenka.

This year 90 species of resident and migratory birds have been identified. Migratory birds like red chested pochard, pintail, northern pintail, gadwall, Brahmani duck and wigeon were spotted in large numbers on the banks of the Mahanadi. “The increase in the number of birds visiting the Athagarh forest region is attributed to successful bird conservation programmes,” said a forest official. Availability of open wetlands, which have enough prawns, fish , frogs, molluscs and snakes, are drawing the migratory birds, said the official.

In Bhitarkanika, six rare common pochard birds were sighted during the avian census after five years in Bhitarkanika, said divisional forest officer of the park Bikash Ranjan Dash.

“The number of birds have increased due to the availability of open space after the eviction of large tracts of illegal prwan gheries,” said the officer. Around 100 persons, including ornithologists from Bombay Natural History Society, Mumbai, officials of wildlife organisations and wildlife activists comprising 16 teams took part in the bird count.

Migratory birds from central Asia and Europe come to the water bodies, wetlands and mangrove forests of the park every year. In 2019, 1,09,059 birds had arrived in Bhitarkanika. The year before there were 1,12,937 migratory birds of 83 species.

However in 2017, the forest officials counted only 76,268. In 2015, forest officials counted 81,401 birds and in 2016 the authorities sighted 1,0,6,356 birds, added the forest officer.

MUMBAI: Mantralaya staffers affiliated to employees as well as gazetted officers’ union will join the countrywide Bharat Bandh on January 8. The strike call has been given by central trade unions to protest the Centre’s “anti-labour policies”.

In a press release, Maharashtra State Government Employees' Confederation said the government has been coming out with policies without holding discussions with people directly impacted by these laws.

“The public distribution system is in the doldrums. Labour policies have been changed to favour owners and corporates. The economic slowdown and growing unemployment have further added to problems of the labour class,” said the press release, adding inflation and rising prices have hit the working class hard.

The confederation had demanded implementation of the old pension scheme for all and retirement age’s extension to 60 years for state employees as well as teachers.

The state has warned employees not to participate in the strike or else face disciplinary action.

Anil Acharya, Mumbai president, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), said insurance, bank and port trust employees with aanganwadi workers, domestic workers led by Communist Party of India and All India Trade Union Congress will demonstrate at Azad Maidan. INTUC will hold demonstrations at Bharat Mata with textile mill workers. The Centre for Indian Trade Union will hold demonstrations at Bhandup while Shiv Sena’s Bharatiya Kamgaar Sena will demonstrate at the airport. “There will be no rail or rasta roko,” he said.

BEST will ply buses in full strength, though it has sought police protection and will install window grilles as a preventive step. Taxis and autos will ply too, said unions. Aggregator cabs will be available.

KOLKATA: The mercury dipped marginally on Tuesday as the minimum temperature receded to 12.2°C from Monday’s 12.6°C. Met officials predicted that there would be a rise in temperature on Wednesday while a western disturbance would trigger light rain in the city on Thursday.

However, the temperature is likely to dip again from Friday onwards. “A portion of the western disturbance will reach Kolkata by Thursday, causing light rain in the city. But this time the rain will be of less intensity and duration,” said an IMD official.

This will be the second instance of winter rain this year. With moisture accumulating in the run-up to Thursday’s rain, the mercury could go up to around 14°C by Wednesday, according to the official.

A western disturbance is an extratropical storm that originates from the Mediterranean region and is capable of triggering winter rain in the planes of Indian subcontinent and snowfall in higher altitudes.

KALYAN: A 29-year-old teacher with a private school died while crossing the railway tracks after being hit by a local train near Kalyan railway station on Wednesday morning. She was allegedly wearing headphones .

The deceased, Antu Dubey, was a resident of Lok Udyan building in Kalyan (East). She was a teacher with a private primary school in Patripul and studying for her DEd (diploma in education) from Saket College in Kalyan (East). A family member said, “Today she used the tracks as a ‘short-cut’ as she was in a hurry to take her exam.”

GRP officials said she was on her way to an Ulhasnagar-based college for her first-year DEd exam when tragedy struck. They said instead of using a bridge to reach Kalyan station to take a train for Ulhasnagar, she took the Sanglewadi route, which several use as a “short cut” to reach the station by illegally crossing the tracks. GRP said when Dubey was on the tracks, a down Kalyan-CST train hit her from behind, killing her on the spot.

Those who witnessed the accident said Dubey was wearing headphones and might not have heard the approaching train. Valmiki Shardul, senior police inspector of Kalyan GRP, though, said, “The deceased was crossing the railway tracks when a train hit her from behind, but we did not find any headphones at the spot.”

Following the incident, locals have demanded that the Central Railway reopen the shut path from the Servoday side so that they can directly reach Kalyan station. CR officials said they had constructed a protection wall to discourage people from using the railway tracks to reach the station.

Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar (Photo: Twitter/ @mamidala90)

NEW DELHI: In a rare interaction with the media on Monday, Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar reiterated his earlier statement that Sunday’s violence had its origins in the protest against the hostel fee hike. He said police were investigating the entry of the masked assailants into the campus and the university too had set up an inquiry panel. He announced the resumption of the registration process for the new semester and said it had been extended till January 12.

When asked who the masked attackers could have been, Kumar only said, “Some students who have been protesting against the fee hike had earlier attacked me. Then on January 3, some people with masked faces entered JNU and damaged the servers in the data centre.” He added that this was the first time the institution had seen masked intruders and wondered if their demands were genuine why they felt the need to hide their faces.

As for why the administration hadn’t used the proxy servers for the registration process after the regular servers were damaged, Kumar replied, “These are technical details that we must not get into it.” He, however, revealed that the damaged set-up was now functional and the registration process had been extended to January 12. Later, he tweeted that 3,552 students had registered for the winter semester.

The VC described the mob attack on students and teachers as “very unfortunate”. He said, “Our campus is known for debates and discussions while resolving problems. Violence is not a solution.” He also requested everyone not to “add additional versions to whatever is going around and cause confusion”.

Explaining the late entry of police into the campus, Kumar said JNU had its security and did not rush to the cops unless there was an emergency situation. “On Sunday, as soon as we learnt of the possibility of violence, we called the cops,” he claimed. He disclosed that the chief proctor was holding an inquiry into the events of January 5.

“Let us make a new beginning, put whatever has happened behind us and work together to make our university a great institution,” the vice-chancellor asked students.

Kumar said the University Grants Commission would bear the utility and service charges of the hiked hostel fees and dispelled rumours that the students would be asked to bear the charges after admission. “There is nothing like that,” he said. “This is recorded in the discussions with the HRD ministry.”

Visakhapatnam: Normal life was affected in many places in Vizag agency due to the 48-hour Manyam bandh, which ended on Tuesday night. With most of the shops remaining closed, locals struggled to purchase essential commodities and food items. The 48-hour bandh call, given by tribals under the banner of joint action committee (JAC) demanding strict implementation of AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation Act of 1959, was largely peaceful in all 11 tribal mandals of the agency area.

Araku valley, which is crowded by tourists at this time of the year, wore a deserted look on both Monday and Tuesday as all the establishments, including hotels and restaurants, remained closed. The tourists already in Araku mostly confined themselves to their hotels. Many tourists, who were unaware of the bandh call, returned midway after noticing the curfew-like atmosphere. Most resort owners incurred losses due to the two-day bandh and expect brisk business ahead. tnn

Kolhapur: The district administration has received 16 proposals, mainly from NGOs , to provide food at just Rs 10.

The poor will be served with ‘ Shivbhojan Thali ,’ the poll promise of Shiv Sena. Four centres serving ‘Shivbhojan Thali’ will be opened in phases. The first centre is scheduled to come up in January 26 on the occasion of Republic Day.

The district administration has claimed that after the announcement, 16 organisations, mostly NGOs from the city and the district, have approached district collector Daulat Desai expressing interest to provide food to the poor at Rs 10.

Desai said, “We have received 16 proposals so far. We are going to start the first centre on January 26. The NGO will be finalised after proper study. The food and drugs administration (FDA) authorities will be involved in the process to provide quality food to the people.”

The state government has allocated 600 thalis every day between 12 pm to 2 pm for the district. Proposals for the same have arrived from women self-help groups and hotels.

The cost of one thali will be around Rs 50. The state government is going to give subsidy of Rs 40 for each thali to the agency assigned to run the centre. The cost per thali will be lesser in rural areas.

Around 150 thalis will be made for one centre. The food served will be two chapatis, one bhaji, one dal curry and rice.

Desai said that the centre should accommodate at least 25 people at a time. The NGOs, self-help groups and hotels having their own facility will be given priority to run the centre.

The centre will be finalised in one of the busiest areas of the city.

Panaji: Padmashree Suresh Gundu Amonkar , who breathed his last recently, not only headed the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education for two terms, but Amonkar also headed the organisation of education board chairpersons from across the country, educationist Madhav Kamat said on Tuesday.

It was during this time that the national education policy was framed with Amonkar’s contribution, he said.

He was speaking at a joint condolence meet organised by Institute Menezes Braganza, Goa Konkani Akademi , Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Konkani Lekhak Sangh, Jaag and Bimb.

“When he (Amonkar) was chairman of Goa Board, the then Goa governor questioned the board’s autonomy. Amonkar defended and successfully retained the autonomy of Goa Board. The case study was then circulated across the country. That was Suresh Amonkar's finest moment and Goa’s proudest moment,” Kamat told the gathering of renowned Konkani writers, intellectuals and former students of Amonkar.

Businessman Arun Baba Naik said that when he was Amonkar’s student, at Mapusa’s New Goa English High School, he recollects criticising the meagre lab facilities among fellow students at the time. “I later regretted it when I realised with what difficulty he was running the school. Later in life, he told me how his mother had finally offered to sell her gold to run the school,” Naik recalled.

Finance secretary Daulat Hawaldar, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat and writer N Shivdas were also among those who spoke at the event.

Kochi: A builder, whose project is adjacent to one of the apartment complexes scheduled to be demolished at Maradu , has approached the high court, alleging that the insurance availed by state government for possible damages is inadequate. While the policy availed by the government is for Rs50 crore, the builder said a policy of Rs125 crore is required to cover their property alone.

The petition was filed by Heera Construction Company Pvt Ltd regarding possible damage to their apartment complex named Heera Windfaire, which is adjacent to Golden Kayaloram.

In the petition, it is alleged by the builder that the authorities have not taken proper steps to cover the risk to their building, which is situated very near to Golden Kayaloram. The subcollector, who inspected the buildings several times, is not divulging the steps taken to provide compensation in case of damage, the builder has alleged. Authorities are duty bound to take sufficient insurance coverage for their property, the builder has contended.

According to the petition, there are 95 apartment units in Heera Windfaire and the builder has already spent around Rs95 crore. A total of 80% of the apartments have been sold, the petition said.

The nearest distance between Heera Windfaire and Golden Kayaloram is 6m whereas the highest distance is 11m. While authorities are liable to take insurance policy for Rs125 crore to compensate for possible damage to Windfaire, they have only taken a policy for Rs50 crore to compensate for the damage to all buildings in the vicinity, the builder has alleged while stating that the extent of insurance cover is grossly inadequate.

A court directive to the government to either avail insurance for Rs125 crore to compensate damage to Windfaire or given an undertaking in writing to compensate for the damage from demolition is being sought by the builder.

474,['8/01/2020'],Dehradun: ITBP gives go- ahead to proposed Dehradun - Mussoorie ropeway,"This story is from January 8, 2020

yyyyyyyyy

DEHRADUN: The Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has given its go ahead to the route of the proposed Dehradun - Mussoorie ropeway project, which will go over its academy, avoiding sensitive assets like the firing range and combat training zone in the campus, which is spread over 275 acres near Mussoorie.

In March this year, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had laid foundation stone of the proposed ropeway, which would cut down travel time from Purkul village in Dehradun and Mussoorie to 16 minutes.

Apart from the difficult hilly slopes, the biggest bottleneck in the project was the sensitive installations of the ITBP. “After a top-level meeting, the decision (to give the ropeway route clearance) has been communicated to the state government. Meanwhile, we have sought 5 acre land in Dehradun for the ITBP,” said a senior ITBP official, who didn’t want to be named.

The site survey for the ropeway’s proposed route over the ITBP has been completed. Possible coordinates for the construction of ropeway pillars are also being identified. According to tentative plans, the ropeway route will have 23 towers and be over 5.5 km long, starting from Purkul village, passing through Kyarkuli, Bhatta village and ITBP, before terminating in Mussoorie.

The ITBP academy was set up in 1973 and gives specialised in-service training courses like bomb disposal, rock climbing, commando, and shooting to personnel. “There were many concerns like height, location and the exact time span for which the cable car would be in airspace over the ITBP academy. The route that has now been agreed upon clears all the mandatory security requirements,” said the ITBP official.

The ropeway project, worth over Rs 300 crore, is likely to be completed in three years and is expected to be a big attraction for those going to the Queen of Hills from Doon.

Visakhapatnam: In a boon to the job aspirants of Vizag city, Andhra University entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Hoon Maritime Institute, Kolkata to set up Hoon Maritime Skill Development Centre on AU campus on Tuesday.

The project, which is estimated to cost about Rs 5 crore, will offer post-sea training courses. AU registrar professor V Krishna Mohan and Hoon Maritime Institute principal Akash Hoon signed on and exchanged the MoU documents in the presence of vice-chancellor professor PVGD Prasad Reddy.

Speaking on the occasion, professor Reddy said that in the absence of institutes offering post-sea oriented courses in Andhra Pradesh, the aspirants are forced to go to other metro cities. “The proposed Skill Development Centre will do away with this major challenge for the job aspirants,” said professor Reddy. Professor Reddy added that the swimming pool on the campus, which was closed several years ago, will be excavated for the training purposes. “Andhra University and the people of Vizag city will reap benefits from the institute. There is a huge scope for employment for the post-sea trainees in foreign countries,” said Prof Reddy.

Akash Hoon, an alumnus of the varsity, said that he is happy to collaborate with his alma mater for the Maritime Institute. “Even the class X passouts can secure good jobs by getting training in the post-sea courses at the institute. This may lead to foreign shipping companies setting their offices in Visakhapatnam,” said Hoon.

Dean (Academics) Prof K Venkata Rao, Chairman of Hoon Institute Kiran Hoon and others were present.

Mohammed Jiyavudeen secured 554 of the 1,360 votes polled in the village which has 60 Muslim votes

TRICHY: In these times of strife and threats of polarisation on communal lines, a village panchayat in Pudukottai district stands out as an example of harmony.

Seriyalur Inam in Keeramangalam, which is dominated by Hindus, has elected a Muslim as panchayat president to express their solidarity with those opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act. Mohammed Jiyavudeen, 45, secured 554 of the 1,360 votes polled in the village which has 60 Muslim votes. “Shankar, who was among the five contestants for the post, came close, receiving just 17 votes less than Jiyavudeen,” said K Rajagopal, a villager who supported Jiyavudeen’s candidature.

The mutharaiyar and vellalar communities have the biggest vote share, besides people from the scheduled castes (SC).

Seriyalur Inam was among many panchayats in the state where president posts had been auctioned, said C Rajagopal, another villager. The post was auctioned for Rs 10 lakh.“We were not in favour of auctioning the post as it would do no good to the local people,” he said. S V Kamarasu, a resident of the village, said that citing the auction one of the candidates even got a promise from each family head that they would vote for him. “When the Union government is trying to create a divide among people of different religions by passing the CAA, we, the Hindus in the village, chose to elect a Muslim to keep our panchayat united and secular,” he said.

Jiyavudeen said that it was heart-warming when a family head came to him saying that he voted for a Hindu candidate as he had made a promise to him, but made four of his family members cast their votes in favour of Jiyavudeen. Jiyavudeen’s standing as a social worker in the village too helped to consolidate his prospects in the election. His extensive work to rehabilitate local people affected by cyclone Gaja had made him popular. Financially stable after having worked in gulf countries for decade, he founded the Seriyalur Inam Youth Development Committee in the village to create livelihood options for farmers devastated by the cyclone.

Jiyavudeen said his first task as panchayat president will be to bring Cauvery river water to the village Ayyankulam tank that is spread across 25 acres. Through the committee, he has been striving to revive a kilometre-long canal to bring the water.

The chairman underlined the importance of a public hearing on the annual revenue requirement (ARR) of discoms and proposed tariffs for the upcoming financial year.

The chairman also suggested that petitioners approach the commission with relevant ideas and solutions, instead of discussing issues beyond the APERC’s ambit.

The commission, said the chairman, strives to bridge the gap between consumers and power utilities and assist the government in uninterrupted power supply. The APERC also highlighted its priority to nine-hour free power supply during the day to the agricultural sector. The APERC holds public hearings after discoms submit their ARR and proposed power tariffs to the state government.

HYDERABAD: Notwithstanding TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao ’s hard talk that indiscipline and groupism would not be tolerated, the party leadership is very much worried about infighting and differences within the party in various districts ahead of the January 22 municipal elections. The party leadership believes this could impact the results though it is confident of winning the elections.Sources said the party was particularly wary about two groups operating in every district. While one group consists of leaders who have been with the party for a long time, the other group has members and leaders who have joined TRS after 2014. Soon after the 2014 elections, the party inducted several MLAs, MPs and MLCs and this has resulted in infighting within the party as one group tries to dominate the other.Sources said groupism and infighting was seen more in erstwhile Mahbubnagar, Karimnagar, Khammam, Rangareddy and Nizamabad districts. “KCR and working president KT Rama Rao are well aware of groups and warned leaders in the last assembly, Lok Sabha and also local bodies elections. Some leaders were denied a ticket and some were kept out of the loop,” a senior leader explained.KCR, who addressed the party workers a few days ago, made it very clear that groupism has no place in TRS. He spoke with former Medchal MLA M Sudheer Reddy who wanted more tickets for his followers in the coming polls. Ch Malla Reddy, who joined TRS and contested the 2018 elections from Medchal, is a minister now, while Sudheer is sulking.In Khammam, former minister Tummala Nageswara Rao and minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar represent two groups and in the erstwhile Mahbubnagar district, former minister Jupally Krishna Rao and Kollapur MLA Beeram Harshavardhan Reddy, who joined the party after 2018 elections, do not see eye to eye and share the dais. Supporters of both the groups came to near blows in the gram panchayat elections held a few months ago.In Karimnagar district, Manakonduru MLA Rasamayi Balakishan does not get along with other leaders and has alleged that some persons had tried to defeat him in the elections. “Infighting within TRS has gone up in recent times.

The move comes within two months of inaugUration of the open gym in city Gandhi's park

DEHRADUN: City residents may soon have to shell out money to use the newly-inaugurated open gym at Gandhi Park. The proposal to fix a price for using gym equipment at the city’s first open gym will be mooted in the board meeting of Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) which is scheduled on January 9-10, officials said.

The move comes within two months of the inauguration of the open gym in Gandhi Park. The open gym, built by DMC, was inaugurated amidst much fanfare by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on November 18 last year. During its inauguration, DMC officials had assured the residents that using the open gym, where basic gym equipment are installed, will ""always be free of cost.""

However, as per sources from city’s civic body, the decision of setting a fee for using the open gym was taken after it was noticed that people had started using the machines “carelessly”. “Within a week of the inauguration of the gym, we found that most of the machines had loose screws and many of them were creaking due to careless use by the public. As we have to place permanent staff there to ensure the upkeep of the machines, the idea to charge people for using equipment was mooted,” said a DMC official.

As per DMC’s proposal, a person is likely to be charged Rs 600 for using the open gym for three months. A six-month gym membership may cost Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,800 may be charged for a one-year subscription.

Talking to TOI, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey confirmed that the proposal to make the open gym chargeable will be mooted in the upcoming board meeting. “We will also be passing the proposal of making open gyms in all 100 wards of the city. These new open gyms would also not be free. Besides, we will be finalising proposals of making 10 more vending zones and a bio-medical waste plant,” said Pandey.

Nooran sisters Jyoti and Sultana cast a spell with their soulful sufi songs at Kalidas Mahotsav, on Tuesday

NAGPUR: Sufi songs have an unmatched aura around them that make connoisseurs of music do some soul-searching. May it be devotional songs or ghazals, Sufism transports people into a different realm of music.Nooran Sisters from Jalandhar, Jyoti and Sultana, caught the pulse of the audience from the word go and gave a breathtaking performance of Sufi songs, marking the culmination of three-day Kalidas Mahotsav held at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh, Reshimbagh, on Tuesday.Representing Sham Chaurasia gharana of classical music, the sisters were trained by their father Ustad Gulshan Mir from early childhood.The sisters meandered through the mystic ‘Yeh zameen jab na thi, yeh jahan jab na tha, chaand suraj na tha, aasman jab na tha’ that showed the inner beauty of Sufi songs. There was ‘Allah hoo, Allah hoo’. Simple but effective words. And the sisters were like one when they performed.Jyoti and Sultana took the auditorium by storm with popular ‘Jhoole jhoole laal dam mast qalandar’. Their rendition was impeccable. The audience erupted in joy when they sang ‘Patakha guddi’, a famous song from Hindi movie ‘Highway’.Earlier, it was the turn of classical vocalist Aditya Khandwe who made the audience soak in Banarasi gharana gayaki. The vocalist chose raag Multani and presented a bandish in teen taal, ‘Mann kahe ko soch kar haare’. He was ably accompanied by Shrikant Pise (harmonium), Suresh Popatkar (tabla) and Rudra Pratap Dubey and Mayur Patare (tanpura).Khandwe later chose a tarana in drut teen taal and concluded the performance with high-pitched aalap.This was followed by dazzling display of Odissi dance by Sushree Mohanty. It was a visual treat when she perfectly balanced postures and facial expressions reflecting the culture of Odisha. She also presented a piece highlighting the joy of monsoon season.

483,['8/01/2020'],Civic hosps face shortage of anti-rabies vaccine,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Kolhapur: Civic-run hospitals and clinics are facing shortage of anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) as city is witnessing rise in number of dog bite incidents.

An official from Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) health department said that order for immediate procurement of 100 vials of ARV has been given and after that stock of 1,000 vials will be procured.

“The stock of the ARV vials is depleting owing to increase in demand mainly due to rise in number of dog bite cases,” he said.

A senior health official of the KMC said, “The stock of ARVs is depleting and there has been shortage since last one week. We have ordered 100 vials for immediate use which will arrive in the next two days. We are getting 10 to 15 dog bite cases every day. Citizens prefer the KMC-run hospitals, mainly Savitribai Phule Hospital, to get the vaccination over private hospitals and clinics. Since April last year we are providing vaccination at 50% of the cost charged by other hospitals and this might be the reason for increase in the number of patients approaching us.”

The cost of the vaccines in the other hospitals is high owing to which most of the government-run hospitals make the vaccines available. Major flow of patients bitten by dogs is at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje civil hospital run by the state government and Savitribai Phule Hospital run by the KMC.

Currently, there is no shortage of ARVs at the CPR hospital and the KMC health officials are advising patients to go to the CPR for the treatment.

KMC hospitals charge Rs 250 for administering ARVs as against Rs 500 to Rs 600 charged by the private hospitals.

“We have supply issues as we do not get adequate supply from the suppliers. We invite tenders from suppliers and those quoting the minimum amount are selected for supplying the vaccinations. The process takes time, however, we make cash payment so that the suppliers make the ARVs available immediately,” the health official said.

484,['8/01/2020'],Govt considering plant to turn waste plastic into useful products,"This story is from January 8, 2020

Panaji: As the state government is thinking of ways to tackle Goa’s rising plastic waste problem, a solution being explored by the government is the possibility of setting up a plant that could convert plastic waste into byproducts. Chairs, plastic sheets and pavement blocks are some of the byproducts that can be manufactured using recyclable plastic. An agency that approached the state environment ministry with the solution has been told to submit a detailed proposal for the government’s consideration.

“Plastic waste has a lot of volume, but no weight. This makes it very expensive to send the waste outside the state for recycling,” environment minister Nilesh Cabral said. More than 400 tonnes of trash is generated daily in the state with more than half of it being plastics and non-recycleables. But, currently, Goa does not have any major recycling plant and all the waste goes to plants outside the state for processing.

Cabral said that he has informed the officials of the waste management ministry that setting up such a plant in the state can be considered on a ‘build-operate-own’ basis.

“The waste management ministry will see if there is a possibility of setting up such a plant which will produce value added products from plastic waste,” Cabral said.

The environment ministry had announced that a ban on plastics would be imposed in the state, which led to many agencies and companies to come forward with solutions.

At the Saligao solid waste treatment plant, hard plastics like from TV remotes and food storage boxes are sent for recycling to plants outside Goa. Similarly, PET bottles are sent to units outside the state that powder them and use for them for various purposes.

KORAPUT: A day after a junior engineer (JE) of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) in Koraput district went missing in the district, police recovered his body on Tuesday afternoon .

The deceased JE is identified as M Venkat Rao, working in Borigumma block in the district.

An official said Rao, along with the sub-divisional officer concerned, two contractors and two former sarpanchs of Borigumma block, had gone to Haradiguda village in the block to provide layout for a piped drinking water project and went missing from the spot. Rao was with the team from 10am to 12noon. The team was supposed to walk a few metres down the hill to reach the spot.

“As Rao was physically weak, they asked him whether he would join them or wait on the hilltop to which he preferred the latter,” said Sasi Bhusan Mishra, executive engineer, RWSS, Koraput.

According to Mishra, when the other team members reached the hilltop after completing their job, they found the JE missing.

“Our team searched the area to trace him and when it failed in finding him, a team member lodged a missing FIR at B Singhpur police station,” said Mishra.

Meanwhile, police said the body was found near a forested area near Haradiguda village on Tuesday afternoon and investigation is on to find the reason behind the death. Scientific team has been used to assist in the probe.

“Investigation is on to find out how the official died. All angles will be probed and the body handed over to family after autopsy,” said SDPO (Borigumma) H K Majhi.

486,['8/01/2020'],When mess workers put safety of students first,"This story is from January 8, 2020

New Delhi: On Sunday, it was not just teachers but also many mess workers who protected students from the masked mob. At Tapti Hostel , they stood as a shield and stopped the assailants from even entering the premises. At Sabarmati , one of the vandalised hostels, a mess worker got injured.

Everyone at Tapti, including the mess manager, on Wednesday spoke about Gurdiyal Singh, one of the workers, who had played a major role in keeping its inmates and the staff safe. “He was the one who saw everything that day as he was at the forefront. Thankfully he did not get injured,” a colleague said. Singh was off on Wednesday. “Students came running and entered the mess. We also got scared that the mob would enter the hostel and quickly closed the gate,” said another worker.

On Tuesday, JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh had said, “When the goons tried to enter Tapti, the ones who stood up for the students were the mess workers. It is important to remember them.”

Tapti is closest to Sabarmati Hostel, where around 20 students were hidden in the kitchen area. “When the violence erupted, we sheltered over 20 students — both girls and boys — in our kitchen area. The situation was tense and we only wanted to save our students,” said Radheshyam, a mess staffer who was then preparing food for dinner. As the violence went unabated, some workers were also attacked. Rakesh, one of them, said he was hit on the left leg near the kitchen by a masked man.

Late in the night, many mess workers were around to serve food to the worried hostel inmates. “They ate dinner very late but it was our duty to serve them,” said Radheshyam.

487,['8/01/2020'],Pak Senate bills set tenure and age limit for the service chiefs,"This story is from January 8, 2020

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's national assembly on Tuesday approved three amendment bills fixing the tenures of chiefs of the armed forces, namely, the chief of army staff, the chief of air staff, the chief of naval staff, and the chairman of joint chiefs of staff committee.

Now, the tenure of all the three service chiefs and that of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee have been fixed at three years each on appointment, which may be extended by another three years by the government, while the upper age limit for all the four has been set at 64.

Also, the amendment bills lay out that after an appointment or an extension, the discretion of the appointing authority in this regard cannot be challenged in any court.

The Senate Standing Committee on Defence also gave its nod to the bills, after the NA's approval.

In the Senate, the bills were presented by federal minister Azam Swati. While the main opposition parties - Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) - supported the government, some voices from members of the opposition benches belonging to Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), and National Party (NP) opposed the bills, chanting slogans of ""No, no!"".

Chairman Senate Sadiq Sanjrani, nevertheless, forwarded the bills to the standing committee for approval.

Earlier, defence minister Pervez Khattak tabled amendments to the Pakistan Army Act 1952, Pakistan Air Force Act 1953, and Pakistan Navy Ordinance 1961 in the National Assembly. The bills had sailed through the NA's Standing Committee on Defence for the second time on Monday.

Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government had proposed the bills following the Supreme Court's verdict calling for a legal cover to Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa 's extension through the parliament within six months.

Last year, PM Khan had given a three-year extension to General Bajwa, a decision that was challenged in the top court. On November 28, 2019, the SC allowed the federal government to grant a six-month extension to the army chief. The court also directed the government to legislate and remove the lacunae in the re-appointment or extension of tenure of an army chief within six months.

Under the new, the president, on the advice of the prime minister, can specify tenure and terms and conditions of the service of the chiefs of the army, naval, and air staff, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee. This includes the grant of extension and re-appointments of the services chiefs. The amendment also fixes the age of the services chiefs at 64 years.

Most importantly, the amendment bill ensures that future extensions won't be challenged before any court on any ground whatsoever.

""Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other law, or any order or judgement of any Court, the appointment, reappointment or extension of the Chief of the Army Staff, or the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever,"" the bill says.

Once the amendment bills are passed by Senate, the documents will be sent to the president to be signed into law.

HYDERABAD: With just two weeks left for 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations to go to polls on January 22, the Congress has intensified its election campaign against the ruling TRS by telling the voters that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-government will increase the power tariff if it wins the urban local body polls.

Congress leaders including TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy , working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, working president and former MP Ponnam Prabhakar and MLC T Jeevan Reddy, among others are cautioning the people that the TRS government hiked the RTC bus ticket fares immediately after winning the Huzurnagar by-elections and that it will increase the power tariff after the municipal elections.

During their election campaign in municipal areas falling under Nalgonda, Malkajgiri, Karimnagar and other parliamentary constituencies, Uttam, Revanth and Jeevan Reddy are explaining to people that TRS government is just waiting for ULB polls to be completed to hike “current (power) charges.”

Uttam has called upon the voters to inflict a pinch on the ruling TRS by defeating it. “KCR has failed to give Rs 3,016 per month unemployment allowance to jobless youth, has not filled up 2 lakh vacancies in government sector, crop loan waiver has not been implemented and three acres land distribution to Dalits is not being done,” he said.

AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai

NEW DELHI: AAP is likely to release within a week the list of its candidates for the Delhi assembly elections scheduled on February 8. AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai on Tuesday said the list would be released by January 14.

The outcome of multiple qualitative and quantitative surveys being conducted in all 70 assembly constituencies will decide the fate of the 61 sitting party MLAs. “Most of our MLAs have worked well but wherever we need to change the MLAs, we will do it,” chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal said at his last town hall on Tuesday.

AAP had stormed to power in 2015 with 67 seats, but had lost Rajouri Garden to BJP in the 2017 bypoll and towards the end of the term, five of its MLAs were disqualified under the anti-defection law. AAP is now assessing the performance, public connect and opinion, and winnability of each MLA through the surveys, being conducted by it and some agencies.

There is speculation that AAP may drop close to 25% — or around 15 — of the sitting MLAs. The party, which claims to be on a strong footing due to its work in the past five years, is trying to not allow the anti-incumbency factor affect its performance in the elections.

Senior functionaries Raghav Chadha, Atishi and Dilip Pandey, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from South, East and North East Delhi constituencies, respectively, are likely to be fielded in this election. They have been handling various responsibilities in the party and representing it at various forums. The party is, however, yet to declare any seat for any of them.

Kolhapur: Even as mutton shops continue to be shut on the second day of the indefinite strike, the forum of activists and citizens have decided to set up meat selling centres at three places in the city from Wednesday.

The forum also condemned mutton sellers for shutting down the shops. Meat sellers in the city said that they cannot afford to sell mutton at Rs 480 per kg as fixed by the 25-member panel appointed by district collector Daulat Desai. They said that mutton is being sold at Rs 560 per kg outside the city limits and that the new rate was forced upon them.

They also claimed that agencies such as Foods and Drugs Administration (FDA) and Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) are harassing them by seizing mutton samples and closing down the shops over sanitation concerns.

Meanwhile, a meeting of activists and citizens was held at Shivaji Peth on Tuesday afternoon. The activists and citizens have formed a forum demanding mutton to be sold at the reasonable rates. They condemned the decision by mutton sellers to keep their shops shut claiming that they are facing inconvenience.

Baba Indulkar, convenor of the forum said, “Citizens will get mutton. We will not respond to the decision taken by the mutton sellers. We are going to set up mutton selling centres to sell the quality mutton at Rs 480 per kg in Rajarampuri. We will follow all the rules of the FDA and health administration. We will get the goats certified from the KMC’s veterinary officer. Citizens can get mutton as much they want at Rs 480 per kg.”

Some of the activists claimed that the mutton sellers have challenged the citizens by shutting their shops.

On the other hand, citizens demanded that the FDA should continue their action against mutton shops on a regular basis.

Meanwhile, mutton sellers continued with their indefinite strike. Many claimed that there are less number of goats in the market and that the farmers and shepherd community are not ready to sell their goats at the rates demanded by them.

Sensors have been embedded in the concrete layer to study the stress and strain on the surface from traffic. The pilot project is being done by PWD and IIT Kharagpur .

To opt for the white topping that costs Rs 1.25 crore per kilometre, the expense is Rs 25 lakh more than black top that costs Rs 1 crore per kilometre. But the extra cost is offset by longevity, fuel saving for cars and safety.
