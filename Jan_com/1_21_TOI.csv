0,['21/01/2020'],Bigg Boss Kannada: I don’t think I deserved to be eliminated: Kishen Bilagali,"Dancer Kishen Bilagali has been one of the most popular contestants of Bigg Boss Kannada season seven, so much so that his elimination from the house has caused a stir on social media. The entire weekend saw #BringBackKishen trend and Kishen himself believes that he did not deserve to be eliminated from the show. Excerpts from a chat with him...The elimination was a complete shock. I think I was one of the most deserving participants on the show, which I knew when I went into the house. Once I came out, it struck me even more, because of social media. I don't know if I deserved to be the winner, but I could have definitely stayed on longer and put up a fight. I have given tough competition to everyone in the house. So, when my ouster was announced, I was shocked, more so because I performed like a star and was even crowned the best performer. I am still unsure what happened and why I was eliminated.When I entered the house, I was very unwell. During the first few weeks of the show, I was even admitted to hospital for a day because of severe jaundice. This was how my fight started in the house. But from day one, seeing all the big stars, I just wanted to be myself. I wanted to project myself in the best way, be it in the way I dressed or the way I looked, everything was planned. I didn’t want to be like anything that was previously seen on a show like this. Yes, there were big names from television there, but I wanted to give them something that was never seen before. I believe I have done that with flying colours.I don’t know if that’s a talent. I used to sing ‘Hudugire Nan Weaknessu’ in the house. It has backfired too. But I would say that it wasn’t just the girls. I am generally a sweet, caring and loving person. I think that was one of the highlights for me. Since I like clothing and styling, I used to help the girls dress right and would suggest looks and hairstyles. It worked in building a rapport over a period of time.There’s nothing cooking there. We’re just two good friends. We don’t have that kind of an emotion for each other. I don’t think there would be anything like that. We were two similar souls and our wavelengths matched a lot of time, especially in the way we deal with people. This helped build a strong bond between us.It took a lot of courage for me to speak about that. I never thought that I’d be able to talk about it in front of so many people. I was really happy. In fact, I kind of felt a little free deep inside. I’d always imagined people asking a lot of questions if and when I spoke about it, as it was disturbing. In the house, though, everyone was very sensitive about it and didn’t ask me uncomfortable questions.I have nothing on my mind. I love acting and really want to get started on that front. Dancing will always remain my passion. I am kind of an open book and am going to leave it open to see what comes my way and accept the same with a lot of passion.I don’t know who will make it to the final week, but I’d personally be happy if Shine (Shetty) wins the show. I find him to be a very genuine soul. Apart from that, I also see Deepika as a strong contender for the final week.I’m not sure. I’m still disturbed after the elimination, as it was unexpected to both the audience and me.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73431591,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-120328/73431591.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/i-dont-think-i-deserved-to-be-eliminated-kishen-bilagali/articleshow/73431591.cms

We spoke to a few young city celebs, who have been there done that to share tips from their experiences of student life.An engineer who also holds an MBA degree, actress Aditi Prabhudeva, says, “In my early engineering days, I didn’t realise how important marks would be as a stepping stone for an MBA and so, those semesters reflected that callousness. But once it struck me, my marks improved and so did my attitude towards examinations. It’s a different case that after completing these courses, I turned to acting. The moment I stopped learning my answers by heart while prepping to actually understanding the subjects, the fear of doing badly in my exams also faded away. Try to relax while learning, as a calm mind grabs concepts faster.”Violinist and composer Ambi Subramaniam says that his biggest learning back then was to manage his time well, given that he had a hectic schedule as a musician as well. The musician who did a Bachelors in Business Management (BBM), followed by an MBA in Finance, says. “I remember this one time, when the semester exam schedule had a test every alternate day. I also had a very important concert in Chennai on one of the in-between days. I really learnt the value of time on that trip, as I took a flight right after the first exam, landed in Chennai, performed at the concert, studied my way back on the night flight home and then gave another exam the very next day,” he says.Actress Nishvika Naidu says that her secret to securing good grades were to get her friends together for group study sessions. The actress, a Mount Carmel College alumnus, says, “I was a very restless kid, and wouldn’t study very well when I was alone. Group studies with my friends gave me a different approach to boring subjects;discussions on the topics helped me retain that knowledge. It turned out that I would remember things better when they were discussed out loud in my study circle. The person in our group who was stronger than the rest in a particular subject, would host the session and impart whatever she knew on all the topics and that’s how we’d ensure that all of us do well in our examinations.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73430199,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-144224/73430199.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/celebrity-study-hacks-to-follow-this-exam-season/articleshow/73430199.cms

7,['21/01/2020'],Film City: Demand for the film city project to remain in Mysuru gains momentum,"It appears that the uncertainty about a film city in Karnataka will continue for a while, what with both Bengaluru and Mysuru claiming stake to it. In 2016, the then state government had allotted 110 acres of land for the construction of the film city at Himmavu village, under a Public-Private partnership model, in association with the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy. Mysuru was the choice back then, as the city has nearly 100 shooting locations in a radius of 15-20 kilometres. Over the years, though, there has been no other development on this front and then, in 2019, there were rumours about a film city to be developed in Bengaluru. The buzz about it coming up at the Roerich estate on Kanakpura Road died as quickly as it came owing to opposition from environmentalists. But then, Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayana recently announced that a new location near Bengaluru had been identified to develop a film city, which would be on par with global standards.Stakeholders, though, are far from happy with this turn of events. Kannada filmmaker director SV Rajendra Singh Babu, says, “The late Vishnuvardhan wanted the film city to be in Mysuru because of the city’s association with Kannada cinema.” Associate film director Chandan Kumar adds, “Bengaluru is already burdened with IT sector and other industries.

8,['21/01/2020'],"Bengaluru students tell us how to sport coloured hair on campus, and get away with it","Experiment colouring on a strand of your hair before attempted to change your entire look

Always mix the colour with conditioner, as this avoids dryness of hair

Do not bleach your hair on your own, as this can go horribly wrong. If not bleached properly, your hair may break and fall off in lumps

Once you have coloured your hair, oil it regularly and use healthy and natural hair mask occasionally

Use colour protecting shampoo and conditioners, so that the colour doesn’t run off easily

Start off with colours that are common, and then move onto experimenting with more complex shades

Yeah… when in college, one has to follow a dress code. But do these rules apply to the colours you sport on your hair? Bengaluru’s college students, especially the young ladies, tell us that the way they style their hair is all about self-expression, and the bright hues in them is even ‘artistic’ to an extent. And when there is trouble in the offing (read: teachers looking to pull you up for that splash of ‘distraction’ on your hair) these students tell us how to get away with having the cake and eating it too.Firstly, getting your hair coloured at the parlour is an expensive business. And to have your teacher reprimand you for those lovely coloured locks just when you are showing them off on campus, is a bummer. “Buying hair colour off the shelf and indulging in a DIY process at home is way cheaper. What’s more, you can even use the mix more than once, or even experiment with different shades of colours to bring out an all new colour,” says Niriksha Muralidhar, a student of Jain (deemed-to-be) University — Centre for Management Studies. If you do get caught, you at least won’t have that elaborate amount that you would have otherwise paid at the parlour distressing you to no end.The city’s students tell us that most teachers stay out of your hair as long as you have not made a spectacle out of yourself. “Brighter colours draw attention. In case you want it bright, opt to colour just a couple of strands of your hair or only the tips as that when you are at campus, you can do up your hair in such a way that the coloured bits are not visible. I usually tie my hair in a bun or make sure that only the side, which is not coloured is seen,” says Vanessa George, a student at Mount Carmel College. “Use accessories, like a scarf or skull caps to avoid attention if your campus has a strict dress code,” advises Niriksha.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73429738,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-233264/73429738.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-students-tell-us-how-to-sport-coloured-hair-on-campus-and-get-away-with-it/articleshow/73429738.cms

10,['21/01/2020'],"Despite twin failures, Goa keep the faith","This story is from January 21, 2020

Panaji: Forgetting the tempting biryani and kebabs ahead of him on the table, a FC Goa official picked up a paper napkin and started scribbling. Everyone else simply tucked into their share of the meal at Kolkata’s famous eatery, while the official remained engrossed in his own world.

FC Goa had just lost a crucial Indian Super League (ISL) encounter against ATK at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Saturday. Amidst talk of how Goa had failed yet another test of character – after the failure in Bengaluru earlier this month – the official was still keeping the faith, scribbling down the last five opponents for three teams who are chasing the League title.

“Look, it can go either way. We don’t have it easy, but you can say the same about ATK and Bengaluru FC. We’ve already played the team ahead and just behind us. Everyone else is beatable, wherever we play,” said the official.

Goa’s inferior head-to-head record against ATK (2-1 and 0-2) and Bengaluru FC (1-1 and 1-2) means Sergio Lobera ’s side should have at least a point more than both the sides. Should they remain tied, Goa will finish below.

“We can’t let our heads drop. On the efforts’ front, I don’t think there was any shortage. It was a tight game throughout and only a momentary loss of concentration cost us. Does it feel bad? Of course. But it is in these moments that you can show your true character. We have some important games coming up,” said captain Mandar Rao Desai.

The stakes this season are higher than ever before for the League winner. Unlike previous seasons when the team that finished on top would only get to play the reverse semifinal fixture at home, this time around the League winner gets a cherished AFC Champions League group stage spot, a first for any club in the country.

It is this reward that has kept teams on their toes. The chasing pack know they cannot afford any slipups, and with just five more matches left to be played, don’t be surprised if coaches tell you, and the players, to treat every game as a final.

For Goa, it starts with Kerala Blasters FC at home on Saturday. After stuttering for a major part of the season, Kerala have flexed their muscle, defeating ATK away in Kolkata and then losing by an own goal against Jamshedpur FC, despite playing almost the entire second half with a player disadvantage. They had Abdul Hakku sent off and could be severely handicapped in central defence against Goa.

Assuming Goa don’t suffer any unexpected hiccup against Kerala, the big test will be against Odisha FC, away on a pitch that looks far from ideal for Goa’s free-flowing and passing football . Hyderabad FC (February 5) and Mumbai City (February 12) should be manageable games at home, and then the big away test against Jamshedpur FC.

Placed second at the moment, a playoff spot seems within reach for Goa. But as we all know, everyone wants to finish on top.

11,['21/01/2020'],Love Mocktail: Darling Krishna talks about turning director and producer with Love Mocktail,"Directing a film, says actor Krishna, has always been something that he wanted to do at some stage. He did, after all, begin his filmi journey as an assistant director , who later made the transition to acting. Better known as Madarangi Krishna or Darling Krishna , based on the film (and a song from it) that gave him a good break and got audiences to take note of him, the actor is now ready to present his first directorial venture, Love Mocktail . The film, he says, is very special to him, as he has donned multiple hats for it — he has done the script, screenplay, stunt-and-song choreography, direction and production. But the decision to make his own film, says Krishna, came only after a string of failures as a leading man. “After a few flops, I was looking at a dead end. It seemed like I had no way forward. I knew I had to do something, as I don’t know anything besides cinema,” he says. “I had always wanted to make quality Kannada cinema , so when I had a concept, I could have handed it to another filmmaker to do. But I decided to turn director and producer, and one of the very few who supported me was Kichcha Sudeep. He told me that instead of having some filmmaker make a hit or flop of it, I should take that chance myself,” says Krishna, adding that the film was about reinventing himself.The idea for the film, he adds, came to him during a car journey from Bidadi to Mysuru. “I ran these by Milana (Nagaraj), who has been a close friend since our Nam Duniya Nam Style days, and she also thought they were interesting. Over the next 15-20 days, I had my script and screenplay in place and was ready to go on floors. At the time, though, all I had was `1 lakh in my bank account, but then Milana, who is also one of the leads in the film, decided to co-produce with me. From channeling our remuneration from other films into Love Mocktail, to doing multiple jobs on set, we managed to make do. For instance, there is no stunt or dance master on the rolls, as I choreographed the songs and the action sequences myself. We had no art director either, as we shot in real locations and all the props required for the shoots were sourced by me and Milana. In fact, we even did our own makeup, while Milana helped out the other two heroines — Amrutha Iyengar and newbie Rachana. Since I was also directing, after every shot, Milana would chip in as production executive and make sure everything was working well on the set, while I planned the next scene,” explains Krishna.Love Mocktail, as the title suggests, is a story that follows multiple romances. “The film follows the journey of the hero from his teenage years to his late 30s and the women he encounters over the years. There are four love stories in the narrative, so the title seemed apt,” adds the debutant filmmaker.The fact that they worked on a tight budget means that the focus was on good story telling than a lot of pomp and show. “For me, Love Mocktail is not a film, it is an experience,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73430486,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-127477/73430486.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/darling-krishna-talks-about-turning-director-and-producer-with-love-mocktail/articleshow/73430486.cms

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. (ANI)

AMARAVATI: The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly late on Monday night passed the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 that intended to give shape to state government's plan of having three capitals - executive capital in Visakhapatnam , legislative in Amaravati and judicial in Kurnool .

The amendments to the Bill proposed by the opposition Telugu Desam Party were rejected by the House.

The Bill will be moved in the Legislative Council on Tuesday but the government may face an uphill task to see it through as the ruling YSR Congress is having just nine members in the 58-member Upper House.

Towards the fag end of the day's proceedings, 17 MLAs of the TDP were suspended from the House for a day as they disrupted the chief minister's address. Winding up a nearly 12-hour acrimonious debate on the Bill, Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said by distributing the capital functions and focusing on decentralisation, his government was ""undoing the wrongs and historic blunders"" committed by the previous regimes since the formation of erstwhile Andhra state in 1953.

""We are not changing the capital as such. We are only adding two new capitals. Amaravati will remain the same. We will not do any injustice to any region,"" the Chief Minister asserted.

Listing out his government's priorities related to welfare and development, the Chief Minister maintained that it was not in a position to spend lakhs of crores of rupees on building a city (Amaravati).

""The previous chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu , created only Bhramaravati (illusionary city) in the name of Amaravati. He turned the capital city into a real-estate venture to benefit only a chosen few,"" Jagan lashed out.

""I cannot fool people by showing them only graphics,"" he remarked.

He also debunked Chandrababu's claim that Amaravati was a self-financing project. Earlier, the Leader of Opposition said he was ""pleading with folded hands"" not to change the state capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam.

""Though Jagan is much younger to me, I am pleading with folded hands not to relocate the capital. Amaravati is intended for the future of the next generations,"" Chandrababu said.

At one point during the debate, Speaker Tammineni Sitaram remarked, in reaction to the TDP members' comments, that it was not a change of capital but only decentralisation.

""The Legislative Capital will remain here (Amaravati) only,"" he noted.

Several ministers and ruling party MLAs, who spoke on the Bill, hit out strongly at the former Chief Minister, accusing him of indulging in a scandal in the name of building the state capital.

The TDP legislators, on the other hand, tried to defend the Amaravati project and said thousands of farmers gave up their fertile agricultural lands for it.

""You can't demean the sacrifice of the farmers,"" they said.

The lone member of Jana Sena Rapaka Varaprasad too supported the government on the three capitals, violating the party stand.

Moving the Bill on the first day of the extended winter session, Finance and Legislative Affairs Minister Buggana Rajendranath said the government decided to enact a new legislation for decentralisation and inclusive development of all regions in the state for ensuring ""balanced and inclusive growth"" of AP.

""Regional imbalances, absence of equitable growth have caused an acute sense of deprivation among various sections of the state population, leading to disturbances. The logical solution would be to lay emphasis on distributed development and decentralised administration to ensure fruits of socio-economic progress are enjoyed equally by people of various regions,"" the minister said, quoting the recommendations of the high-powered committee of ministers and bureaucrats, which formed the basis of the new legislation.

The AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, also provides for dividing the state into various zones and establishing zonal planning and development boards.

The village and (municipal) ward secretariats system that the government brought in in October last year now gets statutory backing as it has been made part of the new Bill. The TDP members raised objection to the introduction of the Bill and stormed the Speaker's podium.

Amid the din, the government also moved another Bill to repeal the AP Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014.

The government said it intended to constitute a new Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Area under the provisions of AP Metropolitan Region and Urban Development Authorities Act, 2016.

The CRDA Act was enacted on December 22, 2014 for the development of the state capital post-bifurcation with a specific area demarcated as the capital region.

Now that the YSR Congress government decided to have three capitals for the state, the CRDA Act is proposed to be repealed.

The CRDA (Repeal) Bill has also been passed late in the night.

Earlier in the day, the Cabinet met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and cleared the draft Bills.

The Cabinet also approved the recommendations of the HPC on the capitals issue.

But the government could face hurdles in getting the Bills cleared in the Legislative Council, which sits from Tuesday, as the ruling party does not have a majority there.

16,['21/01/2020'],3 Sikh men stabbed to death on East London street,"This story is from January 21, 2020

LONDON: Three young Sikh men were stabbed to death on a street at Ilford , East London , on Sunday evening by two men ostensibly known to them. Metropolitan Police on Monday arrested two Sikh men, one of them 29 and the other 39, on suspicion of their involvement in the triple murder.

Videos circulating on social media show three bodies lying in pools of blood at the crime scene, with personal belongings scattered all around.

""We were called at 7.37pm with reports of a stabbing outside Seven Kings station in Ilford. We sent three ambulances, three medics in response cars, two critical care paramedics, two incident-response officers and our hazardous areas response team,” a spokesperson for London Ambulance Service said.

All three victims were pronounced dead at the scene.

A spokesperson for Metropolitan Police told TOI: “At this stage, we believe all three victims and the two men arrested are Sikh, and they were all known to each other. We do not know (yet) if they are British nationals or of Indian-origin.""

The Daily Mail identified two of the victims as Narinder Singh, 26, a construction worker, and his friend Harinder Kumar, 22. Sources said Harinder was from Patiala .

Nadeem Rana, who owns Seven Kings Cars next to the station, said he saw ""an Indian-looking man come running in with blood on his hands, telling me to call the police as there were three men in a very bad state who had been attacked and were bleeding"".

That was around 7pm. A neighbour of Rana called an ambulance. “There were loads of people trying to help them. Even the police were giving CPR,"" she said.

“The investigation remains in its early stages, and work continues to establish the exact sequence of events that led to this shocking incident,” detective chief superintendent Stephen Clayman said. “We know that it started near Seven Kings Rail Station and then moved to Elmstead Road. It was a coming together of two groups of men, the result of which was that three men were fatally stabbed. It was a horrific scene for anyone to come across and my heart goes out to the families and those affected by it.”

Jas Athwal, leader of Redbridge Council, said: “An incident like this is unheard of within the Sikh community here in Redbridge. I think tragically there are at least three families who are going to be in mourning, and this is going to last a lifetime for the people left behind.”

London mayor Sadiq Khan said “the horrific triple stabbing” was a tragic reminder of the scourge of crime that continues “to plague our entire country”. He said the only way to tackle violent crime for good was to address the underlying root causes such as poverty, inequality and social alienation.

Ilford South Labour MP Sam Tarry said: “While I have no desire to politicise the issue, it is clear that the loss of tens of thousands of police officers, which have left the lowest numbers on our streets in 40 years, has had a clear and devastating impact.”

18,['21/01/2020'],Kavita Ghai: I was a regular mother till acting happened for me: Kavita Ghai,"Kavita Ghai (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Kavita Ghai (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

If there’s one actress who refuses to age, it is Rekha and following in her footsteps is Dosti Yaariyan Manmarziyan fame actress Kavita Ghai who not only has an enviable style and amazing acting skills but also bears an uncanny resemblance to the beauty of Bollywood. Speaking about the same Kavita, who was in Lucknow recently, said, “So many people who have worked with Rekha Ji especially the ones at the junior level, come up to me and tell me ki ‘Pata hai madam aap baat bhi unki tarah karti hain’ and I’m just like aur batao, I want to know more about her. I’ve always loved Rekhaji.”The television actress who owned a salon in Delhi, learned quite a few makeup tricks from the ageless beauty. “I remember the time when I was just 14 or 15 years old, I would tear out Rekha Ji’s pages from magazines and stick them to the mirror and try to copy all that fabulous makeup she donned. So it’s like, I almost learned all my makeup from her.""She adds, “In my high school years when I was studying in America, the NRI’s and Pakistanis would literally say dekho Rekha aayi hain. For them, I was Rekha, itna importance milta tha. Back in college also people used to say that there was some kind of resemblance with Rekha Ji especially when I would wear Indian attire.”On being quizzed about how she got into acting so late, the actress stated, “Oh! This is still very new to me. I started acting about five years back. I was a regular mother living in Delhi taking care of my three children, in-laws and husband, going for a lot of kitty parties like any other Delhi woman. Acting just happened by chance. So someone spotted my elder daughter at a wedding and the writers and production team of the television serial Manmarziyan were discussing new faces for the show. While Orvana’s name was selected for the second lead of the show, writer Durjoy Datta , who is also a family friend, along with his team randomly said that ‘Uski mom ko bhi check kar lena. She doesn’t look so bad’. So it was like that.”Kavita Ghai (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Kavita said that it was actually her daughters who convinced her into acting. “One day when I was returning from a kitty party, my daughter slid a script into my hand and told me that it was for me to which I obviously laughed. Later I got to know that my daughter sent my pictures to the team of Manmarziyan and they sort of liked my face and asked me to audition. So after a week of persuasion and convincing, I finally filmed my audition tape and handed it to my daughters.”So was she into watching regular saas bahu saga on TV before? “Not at all! I was not really the kind who would sit down and watch television serials except when I had to sit with my mother-in-law for a brief span while drinking tea. When she saw me on the screen for the first time, however, she was astonished because no one knew about it. I had told everyone in the family that I was going to Mumbai to take care of my daughter Orvana. My in-laws are definitely very proud and happy for me though,” she said.The stunning actress, who was in the city for the promotion of her upcoming show Kartik Purnima , says a lot has changed for her post her acting career kicked off. “I can’t thank God enough every single day for the life I have. Earlier my life was so different in Delhi, it was mostly kitties, gossips and all regular stuff whereas now I feel I’m leading a much better life away from all this and full of gratitude. I just feel miracles do happen. Kuchh bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai.”Ask the Beyhadh actress if there is anything else happening on the professional front and she said, “Whenever I take up something, I always say yeh mera last hai. Even for Beyhadh, I was like yeh mera last hai. I just feel ki bas ho gaya. Let’s see if its any different this time.”- with inputs from Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73433026,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/i-was-a-regular-mother-till-acting-happened-for-me-kavita-ghai/articleshow/73433085.cms

Kuchipudi dancer Bhavana Reddy's performance,, staged on Friday evening at Kamani Auditorium saw compilation of beautiful, lyrical compositions, that highlighted the multifaceted persona of Shiva. Bhavana, who started performing at the age of five, and is now carrying forward the legacy of Raja-Radha Reddy, began the 90-minute performance, bringing alive theor the eight significant aspects of Lord Shiva. ""The beginning was an invocation to Lord Shiva, and praising him as the creator of the universe,"" said Bhavana, who further presented an act that depicted Shiva as the cosmic dancer (Natraja) doing– an act for which Bhavana's father, Raja Reddy , is well-known.Another highlight was a rare performance –(a form of song in the Carnatic music repertoire, often known for its complex structure) – which used to be performed in Yakshaganas (a traditional Indian theatre form, developed in dakshina Kannada). ""somehow have gotten lost in translation, and not many people perform them anymore, but it used to be an act that earlier Kuchipudi dancers would perform as solo pieces,"" said Bhavana.Another act presented Virahotkanthita (a form ofor theatrics that depicts the heroine suffering the pangs of separation) showed Parvati pinning for Shiva. The last act was a, written by Narayana Theertha (a 17-18th century saint, who is best known for his songs devoted to Krishna ) on Shiva. As is customary, the performance ended with Bhavana dancing on the rim of a brass plate. Explaining the idea behind it, Raja Reddy, said, ""When you are dancing on the plate, your earthly connections are no more; your prayer reaches to god directly. That's the whole idea behind it.""Applauding the performance, Sanjana Jon, said, ""We are working on a series to promote classical legends, and that is being translated through young performers like Bhavana very well.""Thanking her gurus, Raja-Radha Reddy and Kaushalya Reddy, Bhavana said, “I am very thankful to my gurus who have tirelessly trained me. I can sometimes be a stubborn daughter. They have made me less stubborn during the process, and I have come to respect many things. They have been very patient with me.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73428237,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-532514,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhiites-enjoy-an-evening-of-mudras-intricate-footwork/articleshow/76677824.cms
21,['21/01/2020'],Kangana Ranaut: I started working at 17... I have taken panga since that age,"She took to the battlefield as the braveheart Queen of Jhansi, and now, with the slice-of-life sports drama, 'Panga', Kangana Ranaut is all set to up her game. And this time with jumps, dives, skill and tact on the playing field. In the film, she plays a 32-year-old mom, who chases her dream to be a kabaddi player. Much like the Kangana we know, who dares to dream big and fight every hurdle along the way. In a chat with BT, she talks about her real-life pangas, precious relationships and her idea of an ideal partner. Read on...I think so, and I would like to believe that I only listen to my heart and what I feel is right. I left home at an early age, so I didn’t have any overpowering figure in my life — a father figure or anyone else like that. I started working at 17, so I have taken panga since that age. Even back then, I did what my heart told me to. It could probably be the most immature thing to do, but I still did it. I thought, why should I pretend to be someone else? Why should my reactions be like my father’s or anyone else’s whose experiences are different from mine?Yes, always! When I left home, it was a very decisive moment in my life, because there was obviously a feeling like… what if it doesn’t work out. But then, I told myself…Whatever the consequences are, deal with it alone. Your parents didn’t sign up for this, so don’t turn around and go back to them’. It is not that my parents would object if I went back, but I knew that, hereon, I have to take 100% responsibility for whatever happens in my life. I have seen hard days; there were days when I slept hungry, and my parents could have easily afforded a meal for me, but I didn’t go back. I felt that it was unfair. I had chosen a path, so I had to figure it out and stick by it. Over the course of time, it becomes your second nature. You become that person.Ashwiny met me during a dramatic phase of my life. In my mind, I had completed 'Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi' (2019), but I got to know that the studio was not okay with the film and wanted to bring another director on board. Eventually, I took over. I left a film called Imli and was also toying with the idea of not doing 'Panga'. At that time, I thought I was not in the headspace to do this film, but Ashwiny told me that she would help me through it. I was shooting two units and would sometimes land on the 'Panga' set, thinking, ‘Where am I?’ It was very unlike me. I was so lost, and she helped me through it. She is one of the most organised people I know, and her homework is on point. We both are very passionate about our work and operate from a place where we are on our own.Personally, I feel that most people I work with and have an equation with, are 100% sweet on my face, but then they talk differently when they go into the media space. I never expected Ashwiny to speak so highly of me, because I have learnt this lesson in the industry that if you are an outsider, it suits their narrative to talk about you in a certain way. Even Ashwiny was surprised to see how some people met me so warmly, but behind my back they were different people. She comes from such a positive place that there were never any insecurities with her.I have seen both the sides. I have also seen how miserable your life can be without your family. Initially, when I started out, my family did not support me and that was probably the worst phase of my life. Even though at that age I must have felt… to hell with them, over time, I realised that there are only those many people in the world who will be there with you all along. That’s when I decided to mend my relationship with them and be close to them, because the distance had become way too much. I wanted to nurture our relationship and have people around me, who I could share my life with. That’s precisely what we are talking about in 'Panga', too, that building a relationship with your close ones is everyday work and a process. Even now, while my family and I are there for each other, we can’t take it for granted. We have to work on it and invest in it emotionally, every day. I also think that I could go back and mend my relationship with them because of my success.It would have been very unfortunate if I was not successful, because the kind of person that I am, it would have been difficult for me to mend the relationship. I am not someone who is good with failures, especially when I am dealing with people. When I fail, it does not change my perception of me, but when I look into people’s eyes and see their perception shift, I can’t take it. I completely block myself out and don’t meet anyone. I don’t think that it is anyone’s business to judge me like that. I am sure that I would not have gone back to my family if I had failed, because of my own ego, no matter how much they would have tried to help me. I am sure that I would have made a different life for myself. I am not here for people’s drama, with anyone throwing lines at me like, ‘Kaha tha humne tumhe (laughs!).’ I wouldn’t let anyone do that to me. Now, at least I can say, ‘Maine kaha tha tumko…’When you have so much going for yourself, you tend to get thoughts like… ‘The world needs me, why should I belong to one person (laughs!)?’ Also, with time, you can become compulsively independent in the way you live your life and operate, and the way you create your personal space. Then, marriage seems like a trap. When you are functioning better on your own, than with a partner, then, marriage doesn’t make sense, right? As partners, you should function doubly better. I see that Rangoli (sister) and her husband function well with each other. Emotionally, financially and spiritually, I should do better with my partner than I am doing on my own. If two people are doing doubly well together in these aspects, I am open to marriage. Even if it does not double up, it should not bring me down from where I am. I can see how Ashwiny and Nitesh function beautifully together and enhance each other. They are raising a lovely family together. When I see that, I think, ‘Okay, this works. This is how it should be.’A mother is the person who is most taken for granted in the family. When we were growing up, we didn’t know where the food came from, when the utensils were cleaned and how we got freshly laundered clothes every day. Everything was functional because of my mom. When I started running my own house, I had a team of four people doing all the work, and yet, it seemed a lot. My mom would do so much more for us, all by herself. We start believing that our mothers don’t have emotional needs or dreams of her own. Now, my when my mom opens to me, I can see that she is so vulnerable, and she has always been this way, but we didn’t see it. That is what should change with the film — we need to humanise our mothers; we most often don’t do that. Jaya (my character) is so much my mother, I dedicate this film to her.Even Ashwiny would get calls where someone would tell her, ‘She (Kangana) will destroy your film’. Jassie would get calls saying, ‘Tumhe toh bhagwan bachaye’. I think these are petty games that people play. It’s a bubble that bursts, because within 12 months, I am releasing two-three films. So, I don’t think that too many people believe in this narrative. Jassie is multi-talented, he is a fabulous singer, too. A director’s energy translates on to the entire set. Ashwiny was so homely and positive that it rubbed off on all of us. Even with someone like Richa, we may have different political beliefs, but that does not come in the way while working. The realm of art is such that it rises above political beliefs. I was the happiest to know that Javed Akhtar sir is writing the lyrics. For me, it is an honour to be working with him, even though our political ideologies are different. When I become a producer, I will pledge to never be coloured by any prejudices or people’s personal choices. Whether it is your belief, sexuality, colour or caste…how does it matter and why should it matter when you are working on a film? That is the kind of standard and behaviour I stand up for.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73433030,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-63020/73433030.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kangana-ranaut-i-started-working-at-17-i-have-taken-panga-since-that-age/articleshow/73433030.cms

Speaking about the same Kavita, who was in Lucknow recently, said, “So many people who have worked with Rekha Ji especially the ones at the junior level, come up to me and tell me ki ‘Pata hai madam aap baat bhi unki tarah karti hain’ and I’m just like aur batao, I want to know more about her. I’ve always loved Rekhaji.” The television actress who owned a salon in Delhi, learned quite a few makeup tricks from the ageless beauty. “I remember the time when I was just 14 or 15 years old, I would tear out Rekha Ji’s pages from magazines and stick them to the mirror and try to copy all that fabulous makeup she donned. So it’s like, I almost learned all my makeup from her.""She adds, “In my high school years when I was studying in America, the NRI’s and Pakistanis would literally say dekho Rekha aayi hain. For them, I was Rekha, itna importance milta tha. Back in college also people used to say that there was some kind of resemblance with Rekha Ji especially when I would wear Indian attire.”On being quizzed about how she got into acting so late, the actress stated, “Oh! This is still very new to me. I started acting about five years back. I was a regular mother living in Delhi taking care of my three children, in-laws and husband, going for a lot of kitty parties like any other Delhi woman. Acting just happened by chance. So someone spotted my elder daughter at a wedding and the writers and production team of the television serial Manmarziyan were discussing new faces for the show. While Orvana’s name was selected for the second lead of the show, writer Durjoy Datta , who is also a family friend, along with his team randomly said that ‘Uski mom ko bhi check kar lena. She doesn’t look so bad’. So it was like that.”Kavita Ghai (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Kavita said that it was actually her daughters who convinced her into acting. “One day when I was returning from a kitty party, my daughter slid a script into my hand and told me that it was for me to which I obviously laughed. Later I got to know that my daughter sent my pictures to the team of Manmarziyan and they sort of liked my face and asked me to audition. So after a week of persuasion and convincing, I finally filmed my audition tape and handed it to my daughters.” So was she into watching regular saas bahu saga on TV before? “Not at all! I was not really the kind who would sit down and watch television serials except when I had to sit with my mother-in-law for a brief span while drinking tea. When she saw me on the screen for the first time, however, she was astonished because no one knew about it. I had told everyone in the family that I was going to Mumbai to take care of my daughter Orvana. My in-laws are definitely very proud and happy for me though,” she said.The stunning actress, who was in the city for the promotion of her upcoming show Kartik Purnima , says a lot has changed for her post her acting career kicked off. “I can’t thank God enough every single day for the life I have. Earlier my life was so different in Delhi, it was mostly kitties, gossips and all regular stuff whereas now I feel I’m leading a much better life away from all this and full of gratitude. I just feel miracles do happen. Kuchh bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai.”Ask the Beyhadh actress if there is anything else happening on the professional front and she said, “Whenever I take up something, I always say yeh mera last hai. Even for Beyhadh, I was like yeh mera last hai. I just feel ki bas ho gaya. Let’s see if its any different this time.”- with inputs from Yashi Agarwal",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73433026,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-228310/73433026.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/i-was-a-regular-mother-till-acting-happened-for-me-kavita-ghai/articleshow/73432698.cms

25,['21/01/2020'],"Narendra Modi: Ignore 'medium' hostility, meet people directly, PM Modi tells party","This story is from January 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked BJP workers to have a direct connect with people, disregarding the coverage of recent events by ""mediums"" which he suggested were unfair and had blanked out pro-government rallies.

Addressing the party cadre at the inauguration of J P Nadda as BJP chief, the PM said BJP should not expect any help from ""mediums"" and should, instead, reach out directly to people. ""There is a group which has been aligned with Congress and will remain so in future as well. There is no need to waste time on that score. Each day, they show 10-15 anti-government events but you will not get to see far bigger events where 50,000-100,000 people come out to support the government ,” he said.

“Madhyamon se samarthan milne ki ummeed nahin aur hamein madad se jeene ki aadat bhi nahin hain (the mediums are not going to support us and we have never been dependent on them),” Modi said.

The PM’s remarks appeared to signal unhappiness over media coverage of the confrontation over the Citizenship Amendment Act, though he refrained from referring to the unrest over changes in the citizenship law as well as from specifically mentioning the media, settling instead for “medium” (madhyam).

While BJP’s annoyance with a section of the media for its alleged bias is known, it was the first time that it had been articulated by the PM in public. However, a defiant Modi exhorted BJP to tough out the media’s ""bias"" instead of being deterred by it. He traced what he called the ""alliance between mediums and opposition"" to the larger ideological disagreement, and asserted that BJP had thrived in spite of the nexus. “People’s faith in us remains intact,” he said to applause from workers who shouted “Bharat Mata ki Jai” and “Jai Shri Ram” through the speech.

""They are opposed to our very ideology. Since they have been rejected by people, they have been left with no option but to forge and spread lies and use their ecosystem to fan confusion. We have been watching the consistent attempt to project each issue in a particular light and spin things,"" the PM said.

Modi, however, told the cadre not to be distracted. “Ye chalta rahega aur hum bhi chalte rahenge, isi vishwas se aage badhna hai (They will continue to do what they are doing but we will continue to follow our path, we have to move forward with the same belief),” he said.

Making light of the resistance from ""mediums"", Modi said BJP had succeeded because its workers had forged bonds of trust with people, giving the party a strength that led to formation of the first single-party, non-Congress majority government in 2014 and its return with a bigger mandate five years later. He added that BJP was not here for a short period but would serve the country for a long time.

26,['21/01/2020'],"IMF cuts India’s growth forecast the most, to 4.8%","(Representative image)

India may lose fastest growing major eco tag for next two years, says IMF

NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday slashed India’s GDP growth estimate to 4.8% for 2019-20 citing slowing domestic demand, stress in the non-banking financial sector and a decline in credit growth and also blamed the country’s slowdown for the downward revision in global and emerging economies growth.The IMF said India’s growth is estimated at 4.8% in 2019, projected to improve to 5.8% in 2020 and 6.5% in 2021 (1.2 and 0.9 percentage point lower than in the October World Economic Outlook ), supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices.This is a sharp reduction from the 6.1% estimated in October and below the 5% estimated by the Reserve Bank of India and India’s National Statistical Office (NSO). Policy makers have blamed global slowdown for the sharp moderation in growth and the IMF’s prognosis is likely to trigger a fresh war of words between the government and critics who have slammed the Centre’s handling of the economy.India’s slowdown was also cited as the reason for the downward revision in emerging market growth projections. It was also the sharpest markdown among the emerging economies.""For emerging market and developing economies, we forecast a pickup in growth from 3.7% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2020 and 4.6% in 2021, a downward revision of 0.2% for all years,” said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath .""The biggest contributor to the revision is India, where growth slowed sharply owing to stress in the nonbank financial sector and weak rural income growth. China’s growth has been revised upward by 0.2% to 6% for 2020, reflecting the trade deal with the United States,” said Gopinath while releasing the World Economic Outlook in Davos.India also looks set to lose the fastest growing major economy tag for the next two years and is expected to overtake China when growth recovers to 6.5% in 2021-22, according to the IMF projection.The IMF said that global growth, estimated at 2.9% in 2019, is projected to increase to 3.3% in 2020 and inch up further to 3.4% in 2021. “Compared to the October WEO forecast, the estimate for 2019 and the projection for 2020 represent 0.1 percentage point reductions for each year while that for 2021 is 0.2 percentage point lower. A more subdued growth forecast for India accounts for the lion’s share of the downward revisions,” the multilateral agency said.The IMF also said the downward revision primarily reflects negative surprises to economic activity in a few emerging market economies, notably India, which led to a reassessment of growth prospects over the next two years. In a few cases, this reassessment also reflects the impact of increased social unrest, the multilateral agency said but did not elaborate.The latest estimates come ahead of the Union Budget which is being keenly awaited for measures to boost growth which is forecast at its slowest pace in 11 years.The government has unveiled a series of steps to boost economic growth but experts say more measures are need to prop up growth in the economy which has witnessed a sharp demand and investment slowdown.The IMF said that the balance of risks to the global outlook remains on the downside, but is less skewed toward adverse outcomes than in the October outlook.“The early signs of stabilisation discussed above could persist, leading to favourable dynamics between still-resilient consumer spending and improved business spending. Additional support could come from fading idiosyncratic drags in key emerging markets coupled with the effects of monetary easing and improved sentiment following the “Phase One” US-China trade deal, with the associated partial rollback of previously implemented tariffs and a truce on new tariffs. A confluence of these factors could lead to a stronger recovery than currently projected,” it said.But it said downside risks remain prominent.“Rising geopolitical tensions, notably between the United States and Iran, could disrupt global oil supply, hurt sentiment, and weaken already tentative business investment,” the IMF said.“Moreover, intensifying social unrest across many countries — reflecting, in some cases, the erosion of trust in established institutions and lack of representation in governance structures — could disrupt activity, complicate reform efforts and weaken sentiment, dragging growth lower than projected. Where these pressures compound ongoing deep slowdowns, for example among stressed and underperforming emerging market economies, the anticipated pickup in global growth — driven almost entirely by the projected improvement (in some cases, shallower contractions) for these economies — would fail to materialise,” the IMF report said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73454243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265841,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/imf-cuts-indias-growth-forecast-the-most-to-4-8/articleshow/73454269.cms

28,['21/01/2020'],"Anti-CAA stir: 1,800 from Kerala get summons from Mangaluru cops","This story is from January 21, 2020

File photo of the Anti-CAA protest in Mangaluru on December 19.

KASARGOD: Close to 2,000 people in Kerala ’s Kasaragod district have received summons from Mangaluru police asking them to appear before their officials in relation to the probe into the violent anti-CAA protests that rocked the city on December 19 and left two people dead in police firing.

A majority of those who received the notices are Muslims, and seem to have been chosen on the basis of their cellphone location on the day of the protests.

Kasaragod district panchayat member Ali Harshad Vorkady said as per his estimate, around 1,800 people in Kasaragod district have got notices so far. Vorkady, who has taken up the issue with the authorities here, said: “They are falsely implicating innocent people. Worse, they are insinuating that people from Kerala were behind the riots in Mangaluru. This is dangerous and questions the right of free movement of people even to neighbouring places.”

The notices, sent by an assistant commissioner of police of the Mangaluru city crime record bureau, mention the date and time for the appearance and warn that failure to appear would be construed as “evading the investigation” and invite “further legal procedure”.

Kasaragod district borders Karnataka and thousands of people, including traders, fisherfolk, students and bank employees, travel to and from Mangaluru. For several small towns on the Kerala side, Manguluru is the biggest city in the vicinity and caters to their medial and commercial needs.

Several people contacted by TOI were incredulous at receiving the notices. “I run a crusher unit here and I was in Mangaluru on that day for some lathe work of my machinery. I knew there was some protest going on in the city but I returned to Kasaragod soon after my work got over,” said Chengala resident Ahammed Ashif. He has been asked to appear on January 21.

Muhammed Kunhi, a fish trader from Manjeshwar, said many from the fish-selling fraternity have got notices. “We depend on Mangaluru to procure fish and earn our livelihood, but now we are being termed rioters just because we were there in the city that day, that too many hours before the violence broke out,” he said.

Rameela Moyyaddi from Manjeshwar got a notice even though she was nowhere near Mangaluru on December 19. Her husband Bawa had gone to procure fish from the city and had taken her cellphone, as he often does. “I was shocked, but later I came to know that many people like me have been served notice even though we did not cross the state border that day,” she said.

As reported by TOI in its December 28 edition, a Karnataka government circular issued during the protests asking colleges in Dakshina Kannada district to keep tabs on students from Kerala had kicked up a storm.

What is more, TOI continues to grow, its main paper having added 32,000 readers over the last quarter.The IRS for the third quarter of 2019 shows that TOI has an all-India average issue readership of 58.2 lakh, way larger than the 32.4 lakh readers that its closest competitor, Hindustan Times , has. The Hindu with 18.7 lakh readers and The Telegraph with 4.9 lakh are far behind.While TOI’s main paper gained 32,000 readers over the quarter, its closest competitor, HT, lost 24,000.

Read on to find out what’s inside...Earlier I used to have lunch provided by the production team, but now I carry everything from home. All my food is cooked using minimal oil, salt and sugar. I prefer food made in olive oil. Since I don’t eat rice for lunch or dinner, I substitute it with quinoa khichuri. Currently, I am having only veg food, so two bowls of sabji — which includes all kinds of seasonal vegetables except potato — is a must for lunch. I can’t do without some salad on the side. At times, I also end up having a bit of pickle for a twist of taste.— Parno MittraHaving studio food is a strict no-no for me. Everyone knows I am extremely health conscious, so I always carry food from home. My lunch is fixed — boiled chicken tossed in one teaspoon of olive oil, a vegetable sandwich and a couple of boiled eggs. I also like to munch on dry fruits all through the day. Unlike many, I have the whole egg along with the yolk, as it is great for health and works wonders for me. Post lunch, I eat any seasonal fruit. When I’m at home, I have a small bowl of brown rice too, but not while shooting. I try to have balanced meals with equal amounts of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.I avoid eating out as much as possible. So, having studio food is out of question for me. I always carry my lunch dabba from home. I have been off carbohydrates for a few months now. I am only having boiled vegetables, especially papaya, broccoli, carrot and bottle gourd, without salt, along with a bowl of curd, cucumber and a glass of pomegranate juice for lunch. Pomegranate or beet juice is a must for me, as it works as an antioxidant. Alternatively, I also go for grilled chicken marinated in lime juice and onion paste. Besides, I’m a sucker for seasonal fruits too.I prefer having food cooked at home because it’s much healthier. If I start having studio food, I’ll end up becoming double my size in no time! Even food ordered from outside on a regular basis takes a toll on my health. My lunch is fixed – a bowl of masala oats mixed with vegetables and made by ma. Then there is a boiled egg, a bowl of curd, a cucumber and two fruits — one seasonal and the other, always a pomegranate. Trina SahaOne can’t expect healthy food cooked in less oil, low on salt and sugar from the studio. They cook for hundreds of people and it’s not possible to take these things into consideration. So, I carry my meal cooked at home. For lunch, I have a small portion of rice, soup-like boiled dal, chicken or fish cooked with lots of vegetables, one seasonal sabji without potatoes and two fruits. I’ve seen people raising eyebrows at me for having rice, but I think it’s a good source of carbs, especially if had in the afternoon.My friends are not happy with the fact that I am not a foodie. I can have the same food day in, day out, provided it’s healthy and homemade. Whether I am shooting outdoor or inside the studio, my lunch comes from home. The menu is more or less fixed. I have a bowl of boiled vegetables tossed in olive oil. To make it wholesome, some boiled chicken and eggs are added. Having a cucumber and some curd during lunch is mandatory. At times, I opt for just grilled chicken for lunch. I don’t even know how studio food tastes!",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73472000,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-119067/73472000.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/bengali/celebs-lunch-boxes-get-a-healthy-twist/articleshow/73432401.cms
37,['21/01/2020'],"Nirbhaya case convict not a juvenile, says SC; nixes plea","This story is from January 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected death row prisoner Pawan Gupta’s claim that he was a juvenile at the time of the crime in December 2012 and said it was too late in the day to overcome the concurrent findings of the trial court, the Delhi high court and the SC that he was a major when he and his associates sexually assaulted Nirbhaya, resulting in her death.

A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna gave a patient hearing to Pawan’s counsel A P Singh but accepted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s submission that the trial court’s January 10, 2013, order holding Pawan a major was never challenged and it was too late for the convict to claim afresh that he was a juvenile in December 2012, which was contrary to the records.

The bench said, “In the present case, this is not the first time that the petitioner has raised the plea of juvenility. When the matter was pending before the trial court, plea of juvenility was raised by the petitioner at the first instance. The trial court on January 10, 2013, had held that the age verification report of Pawan Kumar Gupta was received and that the accused did not dispute the age verification report filed by the investigating officer and further, he did not dispute the age to be above 18 years at the time of commission of the offence.

“When the criminal appeal (against conviction) was pending before the HC, Pawan and co-accused Vinay had raised the plea that they were juvenile on the date of commission of the offence. Upon consideration of the submissions, the HC had on March 13, 2014, rejected their pleas of juvenility.”

The bench further said, “The same plea was again raised by Pawan in the review petition before the SC. After referring to the submissions of counsel for the NCT of Delhi and the order of metropolitan magistrate dated January 10, 2013, the Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, had rejected pleas of juvenility by Pawan and Vinay and that order has attained finality.

“Considering the earlier orders passed by the magistrate on January 10, 2013, the HC’s March 13, 2014, judgment and the order Supreme Court’s July 9, 2018, order, in our view, the single judge bench of the Delhi HC rightly dismissed (Pawan’s) revision petition. We do not find any ground warranting interference with the impugned order.”

Among the accused, only one was found to be juvenile, who on confirmation of his involvement in the crime was lodged in a reform home for three years and has since been released.

PATNA: Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University (BRABU) in Muzaffarpur and Nalanda Open University (NOU) in Patna will get new vice-chancellors (VC) soon. A panel of names recommended by the search committees for the appointment of the two VCs was submitted to the chancellor on Sunday afternoon.

More than 24 candidates, who had earlier been shortlisted from the applications received in response to an advertisement issued by the chancellor’s secretariat, appeared for the interview before the search committee on Sunday. It is learnt that those, who were called for the interview and interaction with the search committee, included the VCs and pro-VCs of different universities in the state.

The search committee, headed by the chancellor’s former academic adviser and Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s former VC R C Sobti, reportedly prepared a panel of names for the VCs of BRABU and NOU immediately after the interaction with the candidates was over and submitted it to the chancellor. Other members of the search committee were Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Technical University’s VC Vinay Kumar Pathak and Patna University’s retired Hindi professor and JD (U) MLC Ram Bachan Rai.

Yet another search committee, consisting of Sobti, Pathak and Patna University VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh interacted with the candidates shortlisted for the post of Magadh University pro-VC. This committee also submitted a panel of recommended names to the chancellor.

It is expected that governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan will make these appointments after consulting chief minister Nitish Kumar.

39,['21/01/2020'],Commuters say bus corridors didn’t serve purpose,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Jaipur: The feasibility of the multi-crore Bus Rapid Transport System ( BRTS ) project has come under the scanner after years of its construction with majority of commuters and residents claiming these dedicated lines were not feasible.

While experts have cited studies arguing that priority bus lane was a necessity for streamlined traffic, daily commuters have ruled it out.

Vikas Sharma, who owns a showroom on Ajmer Road said, “The incomplete implementation of project is reason for fatal accidents. Commuters are often confused which streetlight should be followed at junction. Buses have also hit vehicles.”

Commuters also alleged that the corridor was defunct as majority of the times buses ply outside the designated zone to pick up maximum passengers. Moreover, at entry and exit points of these corridors, traffic is blocked by these buses.

Jatin Mehta, a resident of Vaishali Nagar said, “Many people must have noticed that even the low-floor buses do not run inside the corridor to compete with mini buses to pick up passengers. As there is no enforcement, these buses run outside the zones. Sometimes, possibilities of accident arises as many drivers overtake other vehicles while recklessly trying to enter inside the corridor.”

Town planners, however, claimed that accidents near the corridors occurred due to lack of enforcement, not because of faulty planning or lesser width of the road. “There is no record of accidents at BRTS. Sikar Road, Ajmer Road and New Sanganer Road were two-laned on either sides (total 4 lanes) when BRTS corridor was constructed. Now, there are three lanes on either side of the corridor. If the corridor is removed, movement of buses along with traffic is expected to cause more accidents,” said the official.

As per the JDA proposal, BRTS along with Jaipur Metro was expected to bring a massive change on the city roads. It was proposed that once the project is operational, the passengers can avail buses in every 10 minutes. Many of these buses were also planned to be linked with Jaipur Metro to make the network strong. But, nothing has been done so far.

Rajul Gupta, a resident of Mansarovar area said, the department has not only wasted public money, but valuable space on roads. “The BRTS runs only on a small route. Also, approximately the 6-km corridor remains defunct on New Sanganer Road as all the low-floor buses ply on its parallel road, the Madhyam Marg. What’s the use of having a corrdior?.”

Agreeing to the fact, a JDA official source said the project would have been feasible if the entire BRTS network was laid. Till date, JDA has constructed 7 km on north-south corridor (Sikar Road) against the sanctioned 26 km. Similarly, against the sanctioned 13 km, only 8 km has been constructed on east-west corridor.

40,['21/01/2020'],BoM posts profit in 4th straight qtr,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Pune: Bank of Maharashtra posted its fourth straight quarter of net profit, helped by expense control even as gross NPAs inched up in absolute terms. The bank posted a net profit of Rs 135 crore in the quarter ended December 2019 against a loss of Rs 3,764 crore in the year-ago period. Even so, the lender’s gross advances grew 4.8% against an industry average of over 7%.

“The bank has been focusing its lending to the retail, agriculture and MSME segments (which account for about 57% of loans). In the large corporate segment, the bank is lending only to top-rated corporates and is being cautious in the exposure it takes,” said Bank of Maharashtra MD and CEO A S Rajeev.

He said the higher slippages (standard loans going bad) in the quarter were mainly due to two large NBFC accounts — DHFL and Religare. Except for these, he said, the slippages would have been smaller. About Rs 1,328 crore of standard loans turned bad during the quarter.

Also, the bank was able to reduce just about Rs 1,062 crore of bad loans in the quarter — more than half of what it could in the year-ago quarter. The bank has further declared Rs 4,812 crore under the special mention account category of the RBI — meaning it will have to be more watchful on these exposures.

MUMBAI: A new bench of the Bombay high court will on February 3 hear afresh a petition filed by former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar to challenge the validity of her termination by the lender.

As assignments changed, her plea to declare the bank’s acceptance of her earlier retirement as valid and not her termination for cause came up on Monday before a new bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and M S Karnik. The bench posted it for hearing next month.

On Monday morning, ICICI Bank opposed a plea by Kochhar to keep the matter part-heard before the earlier bench of Justices Ranjit More and Surendra Tavade. That bench had in December heard the bank on a preliminary issue of maintainability of her petition.

The bank had sought time to file an affidavit in reply to the petition on merits and the matter was kept for January 13. ICICI Bank filed a reply and also substantial suit against her to return all her emoluments and stock options, running into a huge amount. The suit will be heard separately before a single-judge bench.

Rallyists at St Paul's Cathedral

KOLKATA: A few thousand Christians walked from St Paul’s Cathedral to the Gandhi statue on Mayo Road on Monday, praying for a miracle to “bring back peace to the strife-torn country”. The procession, organised jointly by the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba and the Bengal Christian Council, united the Church of North India, the Roman Catholic Church , the Methodist, Baptist and AG churches on the citizenship issue.

Bishop Paritosh Canning led the rally dressed in kurta and jeans, steering the growing crowd as it moved in a thick mass negotiating peak-hour traffic. The hour-long rally started at 2pm and included priests of nearly 100 churches from the city and suburbs, some dressed in cassocks, accompanied by their parishioners. Some held up the National Flag while some carried anti-NRC and anti-CAA placards. Some parishioners beat on dhols and others sang kirtans and Bengali hymns.

Once in a while, the rallyists broke into, “we shall overcome”, punctuated by “Jai Jesu, have mercy on the country” as they marched along.

“These are dangerous times and minorities are feeling threatened. We appeal to the King of Peace — Shaantiraaj — Jesus — to send a miracle,” said the Bishop. The Roman Catholic Church was represented by its vicar general, Dominic Gomes. “There is fear all around and the Constitution needs to be protected. Christians have come together in a single voice of protest today,” he said.

Principals and teachers of at least 40 schools in the city also participated in the walk. “The anxiety over CAA and NRC is palpable. Look at what is happening in Assam. Never did the minorities feel so threatened in their lives. Though the Christians have not been targeted as yet, there is no guarantee that they won’t be in future. We fear for our schools too,” said T H Ireland, principal of St James’ School. He stressed that after seven decades of freedom and having successfully run as a secular Republic, it’s sad that divisive politics are ripping India apart.

The chief of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, Herod Mullick, said that the Christian community was leading a concerted movement against CAA and NRC, and till there is a let up, the movement will grow in momentum. “We are going to submit a memorandum to the governor and the President about what we think,” Ireland said.

“The Anglo Indians, who are all Christians, have lost their reservation in Parliament and the state assemblies. Isn’t this a clear indication that minorities are being targeted one by one? We are a small community, but an influential one. We shall all remain united,” said MLA Shane Calvert.

BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Foreign fund managers have cut their stake in Infosys by 1.7% between September-end and December-end, at a time when two whistleblower complaints hit the software major. In comparison, during the same period, these fund managers increased their stakes by 2.6% in Tech Mahindra and 0.4% in TCS , while in Wipro and HCL Tech their stakes were almost unchanged, latest shareholding analysis of the five IT majors showed.The combined market cap of these five software exporters, at about Rs 15 lakh crore, is around 10% of India’s total market cap.In case of Infosys, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pared their stake during the October-December quarter (Q3), insurance companies hiked their combined stake by 0.7% and mutual funds (MFs) by 0.4%. In TCS, where FPIs bought in Q3, MFs and high net worth investors (HNIs) pared their respective stake marginally, while in Tech Mahindra, MFs and retail investors pared their stakes, while FPIs hiked.Other than in Infosys, there was no significant event relating to the five software export majors that could have impacted the stock price. Rod Bourgeois, head of research at DeepDive Equity Research, said that the whistleblower-related concerns were the main reasons for pressure on Infosys’s stock price during the December quarter, particularly in October. “In our questions on the earnings call, we asked the chairman about employee impacts related to the investigation, and he indicated that the whistleblower was probably not an employee,” Bourgeois said.Although the company said that forensic auditors did not find anything to indicate that its top managers did some financial jugglery to perk up its numbers, FPI fund managers are still cautious. Hugh Young , MD of Asia-Pacific region at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said that there was some concern about the whistleblower issue. “It has been put to rest temporarily at least, though history suggests it might rear its head again,” he said.These changes in non-promoter shareholding in general and by FPIs in particular came at a time when foreign inflows peaked after the government cut corporate tax rates. A report by domestic financial services house Edelweiss pointed out that FPI flows into India hit a five-year high in 2019 with foreign funds being net buyers at $14.8 billion in the primary and secondary equity markets (against a net-buy of $16.2 billion in 2014).“FPIs particularly staged a comeback in the wake of corporate tax rate cuts in 2019, cheering the move by pumping in about $8.2 billion from September 20 through December 2019,” the report said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73477239,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-297553,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fpis-cut-stake-in-infy-raise-in-techm-tcs/articleshow/73452901.cms

NEW DELHI: The commerce department’s proposal to halve liquor quota for international flyers to a single one-litre bottle at duty-free shops across the country has had a sobering effect on both wine and spirits makers and airport operators.Apart from having a direct impact on premium liquor sales , the proposed move, senior industry executives said, could hamper test-marketing of new products and sales of high-end boutique brands for both domestic and foreign companies.“Curtailing liquor sales at duty-free shops will have a minuscule effect on the government’s plan to rein in trade deficit. Indian liquor companies are currently producing world-class spirits. Duty-free shops are an important medium for them to showcase premium brands to the right target audience,” said Amar Sinha, COO at Radico Khaitan. Some of the company’s high-end brands such as Rampur Indian Single Malt Whisky and Jaisalmer Indian Craft Gin generate a significant percentage of their sales in duty-free outlets at airports.Most liquor companies have launched duty-free-only products as well. For instance, French company Pernod Ricard sells several products, including Chivas Brothers Blend, The Secret Speyside and Royal Salute-The Time Series ‘52 Year Old’ only through duty-free shops in India.“When new brands are launched, people buy at duty-free if they like it. Duty-free stores are places to experiment, stimulate trials and many brands are launched here,” said Amrit Kiran Singh, executive chairman of International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI).“Liquor currently accounts for around 80% business at duty-free shops in small cities in India. Airport operators share this revenue with the government. This helps us increase non-aeronautical revenue and keep aero revenue — raised as landing and parking charges from airlines and user fee from flyers — in check. Any move that hurts non-aero revenue will mean a hike in aero revenue and will lead to higher charges for passengers in the form of heftier user fees or airline tariffs,” said a person in the know.Globally, travel retail volume for spirits is estimated to reach around $10.4 billion by 2023, the growth being led by cane spirits, Japanese whisky and gin, according to IWSR (The International Wine and Spirit Research).

Chennai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered liquidation of Nathella Sampath Jewellery, which downed its shutters in 2017. The insolvency was admitted in May 2018 following a voluntary petition filed by the company. The jeweller owes Rs 461.4 crore to 58 financial creditors and 62 operational creditors and an additional Rs 63.7 crore as advance received from customers for future purchases, which have to be returned.

The NCLT appointed resolution professional Ram Ratan Kanoongo said it has been difficult to find a resolution for the revival of the jewellery chain and the committee of lenders had recommended liquidation with 97.9% voting in favour.

“The deadline of 330 days expired in November 2019, but there are multiple proceedings pending. We were hence constrained to call for liquidation,” he further said, according to the statement.

Prior to initiating resolution process, the Enforcement Directorate also attached Rs 328 crore worth assets under the the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The tribunal further added that ordering liquidation will not have any bearing on the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002) proceedings, because action against erring management will not be affected by the order. The order also noted that a liquidation professional must be appointed and Kanoongo will act as liquidator until such time.

53,['21/01/2020'],Bihar: Schoolchildren all praise for PM’s ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’,"This story is from January 21, 2020

PM Narendra Modi

PATNA: Altogether 70 students from Bihar , including 22 Patnaites, participated in the third edition of ‘ Pariksha Pe Charcha ’ at Talkatora stadium in New Delhi on Monday and got tips from Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi on how to prepare for board and competitive exams.

Those, who could not attend the event, raised questions through video messages. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (Bihar) student Juli Sagar asked, “How can we realize our inner potential?” To this, the PM said, “In order to understand our inner potential, we need to come out of our comfort zones and break our protective shells. Above all, we should understand what activity gives us inner happiness.”

Sharing her experience of taking part in ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’, Navya Ranjan, a class IX student of Open Minds - A Birla School, told this newspaper, “PM Modi explained everything in a friendly manner and laid stress on the fact that an exam is just a phase of life. He also told us to accept failure and use it as a motivation, instead of getting sad or depressed.”

Meanwhile, the teachers and students of city schools like Kendriya Vidyalaya and St Michael’s High School watched the live telecast of the event.

Gautam Singh, a Michaelite, said, “I am not just relaxed, but also determined to perform well in my upcoming board exam. I have decided not to take unnecessary stress.”

Another student, Hansika of Notre Dame Academy, said, “After listening to the PM, I feel so relaxed. I could never get better guidance.”

Carmel High School’s Class XII student Juhi went all praise for the PM’s speech. “He asked the students of classes X and XII to spend some time on extracurricular activities. He was right because only we understand the pressure we have to go through every day. The idea of taking a break from time to time is helpful,” she said.

During the event, the PM also advised parents to find out what their children want to do, instead of pushing them to indulge in something that they do not like.

Inspired by the speech, Mukul Agarwal, a father of two children, claimed, “Everybody in my family, including me, studied medical. I wanted my daughter to become a doctor too, but I think I should try to understand where her interest lies.”

Ashok Rajpath resident Chandra Kanta said, “We always want our children to become something we could not be. I think it’s high time we focused on their dreams.”

Girls wearing woolen clothes during cold and foggy weather in Patna

PATNA: Most parts of Bihar , including Patna, are set to witness warmer days henceforth, except for a couple of days around January 25 when the maximum temperature is expected to plunge below 20 degrees Celsius due to change in wind direction, the Patna meteorological centre said on Monday.

As of now, meteorologists expect dry weather to prevail in the state till January 24 and winter conditions till the end of this month. Mornings will continue to be cold as the minimum temperature is likely to remain in the range of 9-10 degrees C. Low minimum temperature is expected to be accompanied by fog cover in the morning hours.

Minimum and maximum temperatures in Patna on Monday was recorded at 9.8 degrees C and 20 degrees C respectively. Gaya was the coldest place in state with the minimum temperature recorded at 6.6 degrees C.

The weatherman said people will have to bear with cold conditions despite sunny days , primarily due to cold westerly winds. “Cold westerly winds were blowing at an average speed of 9-13kmph in the lower level of atmosphere on Monday and any change in wind direction is unlikely till January 24,” said a senior official at Patna meteorological centre.

The daily weather bulletin issued stated that a western disturbance is very likely to affect western Himalayan region from January 24 onwards. Western disturbances are low pressure area or extratropical storms originating from the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfall in northwestern Indian subcontinent.

According to Skymet Weather, the approaching western disturbance is last strong western disturbance of the season and it was most likely to hit the western Himalayas by Monday evening. As a result, scattered rain or snow was expected in parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh by Monday night. It further stated that the weather was expected to start clearing up from the hills as well as northern plains from January 22 onwards.

The local Met centre, however, denied making any prediction about the impact of the approaching western disturbance on weather conditions in Bihar. “We will have to see if any cyclonic circulation forms over Rajasthan and whether a trough line forms in the region before making any forecast for showers under the influence of the approaching western disturbance. It will be bit early to make any such forecast at present,” an official at Patna meteorological centre said.

New director takes charge at Patna Meteorological Centre: Vivek Sinha, scientist-F, took charge as the new director of Patna meteorological centre on Monday. Sinha was earlier posted at India Meteorological Department’s headquarters in New Delhi.

55,['21/01/2020'],Differences of opinion come to the fore at Park Circus as one group reaches out to governor,"This story is from January 21, 2020

School students form a human chain at Park Circus on Monday morning to protest against CAA, NPR and NRC

KOLKATA: Differences in opinion between two groups have surfaced at the Park Circus sit-in against CAA and NRC on who will be the face of the protest and take the leadership role on deciding daily activities. While a group, led by social worker Asmat Jamil from Ripon Street, has claimed that she was the “organizer of dharna at Park Circus”, another group led by Uzma Alam, a homemaker and activist, alleged that things were being “controlled” at the protest venue by a handful of people. Disagreements had peaked on Saturday when there was a public spat between the two groups. On Monday, while members of one group met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar , requesting him to convey to the central government the public outrage over CAA and NRC, members of the other group distanced themselves from the visit and termed it an “attempt to create havoc among peaceful protesters”.

Every day for the past few days, thousands, including students and homemakers, have been thronging the venue to express their solidarity with the cause and the protesters.

“I am the organizer of the dharna. I came here with seven women and sat here on the night of January 7. Others joined in after that. As long as all of us are protesting against CAA and NRC, people have the freedom to give their ideas and volunteer,” said Jamil.

Alam, however, said, “It is a democratic protest, but Jamil and her people are not letting others express themselves. When I said I have got an appointment with the governor, they said I was colluding with the BJP. On many occasions, the governor has said he is the head of the state and is always open to dialogue, which is why we decided to approach him.”

Alam met the governor on Monday afternoon along with representatives of four organisations and said he had assured them of all help.

“We presented a memorandum to the governor, apprising him of the situation and how CAA and the proposed NRC threaten to tear apart the secular fabric of the country. He assured us that he will look into the matter,” said Alam, who was earlier associated with the Calcutta Muslim Orphanage.

“I have not allowed any political person at the dharna because we want it to be a neutral movement. Several students have been coming here to support us every day,” said Jamil, adding, “I have not been keeping well, but I could not stop myself when the CAA was passed in Parliament because I want to save my Constitution. I have been involved social work for more than a decade, but I have never publicised my work.”

A volunteer who has been visiting Park Circus since the beginning of the protest, and has organized activities to mobilise support and break the monotony, said several activities had to be postponed or cancelled due to disagreement between the two groups.

56,['21/01/2020'],"Rising prices &amp; crude, weak Q3 results weigh on sensex","This story is from January 21, 2020

MUMBAI: An increasing benchmark yield due to the rising consumer inflation, which in December hovered near the 7.5% mark, along with the not-so-enthusiastic quarterly numbers and spiking crude oil prices weighed on investor sentiment on Monday.

This pulled the sensex down by 1% at close. The index, after touching a new all-time peak at 42,274 in early trade, closed with a loss of 416 points at 41,529. Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank , Kotak Bank and TCS accounted for most of the sensex’s loss, BSE data showed.

Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra said the market witnessed selling pressure despite positive global cues, mainly because of disappointing earnings numbers by select Nifty majors. “We continue to remain cautious on the markets, given that the indices are near their peak levels. The expectations from the Budget are high this time around, given the current economic slowdown. This is likely to drive momentum across sectors,” he said.

The day’s session was also impacted by rising crude oil prices, which went past the $65-per-barrel level after supply disruptions were reported from Iran and Libya, both major crude producers. Given the weak economic conditions in India, any rise in crude prices is expected to have a negative impact on the country’s trade numbers, economists say.

In the bond market, the benchmark yield on the 10-year government securities went near the 6.70% mark, up from 6.50% last week after December’s consumer inflation jumped to 7.35% due to galloping food prices, analysts said. Since the benchmark yield is one of the main determinants of the lending rates by banks, this could put pressure on banks to hike lending rates. A rising inflation reading will also hold back the RBI from cutting rates immediately, hurting the economic condition in the country, economists said. All these factors also weighed on investor sentiment on Dalal Street, traders said.

The day’s selling was led by domestic funds, which recorded a net outflow figure of Rs 1,420 crore while foreign funds were net buyers at just Rs 6 crore. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 20 closed in the red.

Gracy Joseph

KOCHI: In a face-saving exercise, Ernakulam District Congress Committee (DCC) has suspended corporation development standing committee chairperson Gracy Joseph , who defied the diktat of the leadership to quit the chairperson’s post. According to sources with the Congress, the party is exploring the possibilities of moving no-confidence motion against Joseph so as to expel her from the chairperson’s post.

It was as part of a plan for change of guard at the helm of the corporation that the leadership asked four standing committee chairpersons belonging to the Congress to step down. Of the four, town planning standing committee chairperson Shiny Mathew, tax appeal standing committee chairman KVP Krishna Kumar and welfare standing committee chairman A B Sabu resigned. But Joseph didn’t obey the instruction of the party leadership.

In the council with a total strength of 74, UDF has 37 members and LDF enjoys the support of 34. BJP has two members while a seat is vacant after T J Vinod, who was the deputy mayor, got elected to the state assembly.

The rift in the Congress in the corporation is widening with most of the councillors and leaders demanding the resignation of mayor Soumini Jain. According to them, there was an understanding for sharing the post of mayor between Jain and Shiny Mathew for two-and-a-half years each. But Jain refused to quit the post. She said she would quit if all other standing committee chairpersons quit. With the removal of Joseph, pressure will again mount on Jain to quit. But those close to Jain said she wouldn’t step down. With only seven months left for the elections to the local bodies, changing the mayor would cause damage to UDF, those supporting Jain argues.

SURAT: In Bollywood super hit 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun ,' groom Mohnish Behl's uncle Alok Nath and the bride Renuka Shahane's mother Rima Lagoo are put in a comically awkward situation when Nath's college-days crush on her is revealed by none other than Lagoo's husband Anupam Kher. All relish this harmless disclosure with laughs and the marriage passes off smoothly.

In Surat, however, marriage plan of two youngsters was shattered after the groom's father and the bride's mother revived their young days’ love and both reportedly fled. The marriage was scheduled in February second week, but the 48-year-old man and the 46-year-old woman, are nowhere to be found for 10 days now.

While the man disappeared from his house in Katargam area, the woman left her house in Navsari . It is strongly suspected that they have eloped, leaving the families in an extremely embarrassing situation. Both families have filed missing persons’ report with the police.

The bride and groom were preparing for their marriage for the past one year after they got engaged. They are from the same community and elders were taken in confidence before their engagement was done. However, the elopement barely a month before the marriage has left everyone shocked.

The groom’s father, Rakesh, (name changed), a textile businessman who also deals in property, went untraceable around January 10. Rakesh, who is also a member of a political party, is a native of Amreli district. He knew the bride’s mother, Swati (name changed), since their young age. They were neighbours in Katargam area and were good friends too, it is reliably learnt.

“They knew each other since they lived in same society. Some of their close friends informed us after they eloped that they had a relationship in the past too. However, Swati got engaged with her current husband in Navsari,” said a relative of both the families.

Swati, whose family hails from Bhavnagar district , got married to a diamond artisan who later became broker.

The elopement has become a point of discussion on social media and photos of the couple are being widely shared.

Ram Vilas Paswan

PATNA: Union minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday said the Centre would implement its ‘ One Nation One Ration Card ’ scheme across the country from June 1.

Talking to media here, Paswan said the facility of interstate or national portability of ration card had already been provided in 12 states from January 1 this year. This facility would be extended to eight more states by June to cover around 63 crore beneficiaries of foodgrains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

“Except few hilly regions in the northeastern states where e-POS (electronic Point of Sale) machines are not fully functional, the interstate or intra-state portability of ration card would be available across the country from June 1,” he said.

Under the scheme, any eligible beneficiary will be able to get his/her entitled foodgrain under the NFSA from any public distribution or fair price shop in the country using the same ration card. The beneficiary will be verified through Aadhaar authentication on the e-POS devices.

“This facility would not be available at a PDS shop where e-POS device is not available or not connected to the interstate portability network,” Paswan said, adding around 35 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA have already been covered under the scheme in 12 states.

The 12 states where interstate portability is available are Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tripura, Goa, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, he said.

To a question, Paswan said Bihar would hopefully be linked to the ‘one nation one ration card ’ platform by March 31 this year. He said the process of automation of around 46,800 PDS shops has been completed in Bihar.

He said the process of intra-state portability of ration card has already begun in 16 states and the facility is fully operational in 12 states namely Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tripura, Gujarat, Jharkhand and Punjab, while it is partially operational in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Under the intra-state portability, an eligible beneficiary can avail foodgrain from any district in his/her state.

Paswan also said around 3 crore fake ration cards across the country were scrapped from the government records during the process of de-duplication of cards through Aadhaar number seeding. In Bihar, around 44,400 fake ration cards were scrapped.

The proposed ‘Vijay Stambh’

PATNA: The sword of freedom fighter, Veer Kunwar Singh , which had vanquished the British soldiers in the 1857 rebellion, will soon shine atop high platforms at four places in Bhojpur district.

The work on construction of the platforms, christened ‘Vijay Stambh’, is in progress and they are likely to be ready by the end of February. In the meantime, the authorities concerned are waiting for the arrival of consignment of the swords being cast at Jaipur in Rajasthan.

Bhojpur district magistrate (DM) Roshan Kushwaha told this newspaper that the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) had identified four places — Kayam Nagar, Bibiganj, Buzurg and Sheopur Ghat — where specially-designed swords of Veer Kunwar Singh would be displayed.

""The Vijay Stambh’ will be an epitome of the bravery of the great freedom fighter. It will also give a boost to tourism in Bhojpur,” the DM said.

He added, “According to historical texts, it was at Sheopur Ghat that Kunwar Singh drew his sword and cut off his hand after being injured by the bullets of the British Army. Hence, this place was chosen for one of the victory pillars.”

BSTDC’s executive engineer Ramashakar Prasad said, “The base of the 15-foot-high ‘Vijay Stambh’ will be 50 feet long and 50 feet wide. A 21-foot-long bronze sword will be installed on top of the pillar and the ground will have green grasses. The entire area will be protected by boundary walls.”

Shashikant Tripathi, a social activist of Kayam Nagar, claimed that a thick wall near a river in the village was believed to be part of the ruined camp of Kunwar Singh. “The new victory pillar is being built at a little distance from that site and will help attract tourists,” he said.

Many people remained stuck in the jam for hours

PATNA: Several prominent areas of the city faced severe traffic congestion from 12pm to 4pm on Monday. Many people remained stuck in the jam for hours, but the worst affected were schoolchildren and patients in ambulances , who could not move ahead.

The stretch from Rajapur Pul to Golghar, Bailey Road, Income Tax Roundabout, Beerchand Patel Path, Ashiana-Digha Road, Boring Road, Chiraiyatand Bridge, Bander Bagicha and Daroga Prasad Rai Path came to a standstill due to traffic congestion.

“Many people came to attend the ‘Maharana Pratap Smriti Samaroh’ from across the state and parked their vehicles on the road. This led to slow traffic movement. Besides, a large number of horses, which were roped in for the event, added to the traffic woes,” a traffic cop told TOI.

The commuters, however, blamed poor traffic management for the snarls. “It is the duty of the district administration to ensure that commuters do not face such problems,” said Prabhat Kumar, who was stuck in traffic near the I-T roundabout and was unable to park his car in Maurya Lok Complex where he had gone shopping with his family.

Chanchala Kumari, who teaches in a BEd college at Bihta, missed her train because she was stuck in Phulwarisharif area for over an hour.

Kankarbagh resident Mihir Jha also complained about heavy traffic on Chiraiyatand Bridge. He said, “I usually cross the bridge in five minutes, but today I was there for thirty minutes.”

Rajeev Nagar resident Jitendra Kumar, who was going to Ashiana-Digha Road, saw two ambulances stuck in the jam for an hour.

Meanwhile, traffic SP D Amarkesh said there was no traffic mismanagement. “Thousands of vehicles had come to the city from outside for an event. That led to congestion,” he added.

Representative image

GAYA: Twelve assistant professors will shortly be appointed in the postgraduate and undergraduate departments of Urdu in Magadh and Patliputra universities.

Sources said Bihar Public Service Commission has recommended the names of selected candidates for appointment and the VCs and senior officials of the two universities will shortly meet in Patna to work out the division of faculty members.

According to MU VC Prof Rajendra Prasad, appointment of assistant professors of Urdu will shortly be made. “The process is most likely to be finalized this month,” he said.

The BPSC had advertised 17 posts of assistant professor of Urdu in 2014, prior to the establishment of Patliputra University (PPU). Since Patliputra University was carved out of MU in March 2018 and 25 of the 44 constituent and three of the four government-funded minority colleges were tagged with the Patna-based PPU, the posts have to be shared between the two now.

The BPSC has made recommendation for only 12 posts against the 17 advertised. The posts, according to sources, have been slashed at the instance of the state government, which earlier conducted a massive rationalization exercise under which number of posts were revised in accordance with the actual number of students of particular subjects.

Meanwhile, MU is facing acute faculty shortage on account of nearly 60% of the sanctioned posts of teachers lying vacant. On the other hand, it grossly overstaffed in the non-teaching category as the apportionment of nearly 400 non-teaching employees between MU and PPU is yet to be done. The apportionment has to be done in the 55:45 ratio with 55% of the non-teaching employees of the MU headquarters to be transferred to PPU.

Asked about the delay in the relocation of staff, MU registrar Sidnath Prasad Deen said it was for the PPU authorities to explain the inordinate delay in the execution of the apportionment exercise.

When contacted, PPU pro-VC Prof Girish Kumar Chaudhary said the MoU for the apportionment of non-teaching employees was signed long back between the two universities. “The PPU has written several letters to MU authorities for transferring the services of the non-teaching employees as per the provisions of the MoU, but the latter has so far spared only 18 employees,” he said.

A student is seen wearing a pollution mask in Patna (File Photo)

PATNA: The air quality of Patna seems to be gradually improving with westerly winds at comparatively higher speed and gradual increase in temperature.

As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the average air quality index (AQI) of Patna on Monday was 144, putting it in moderate category. Incidentally, the AQI of Patna was measured in the range of 350 to more than 400 during the peak winter period over the last two months.

Track the pollution level in your city

According to a senior official at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), the AQI level measured at Indira Gandhi Science Complex (planetarium) stood at 208, while it was 21 at Sri Krishna Memorial Hall, 121 at Rajdhani Vatika and 100 at BIT-Mesra in Patna monitoring stations.

Attributing climatic conditions as the main factor for the improvement of air quality in the city, BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh said: “Westerly winds blowing at comparatively higher speed over the last two days has led to improvement in city’s AQI to ‘moderate’ category. The western side of Patna is comparatively cleaner than the eastern side of the city.”

He added: “Earlier, the low wind speed was not letting dust particles and other pollutants to disburse. However, with the increase in the velocity, the air quality has improved.”

Ghosh said the city witnessed a rise in temperature after several days and contributed to improvement in the AQI. “If the weather continues to be like this, Patna’s air quality will become better,” he said.

Meanwhile, Patnaites had respite from the severe air quality in the city observed during the peak winter period. Boring Road resident Anuj Verma, who removed his pollution mask while commuting on the road over the last couple of months, said: “I get severe breathing problems whenever the AQI is high. However, I felt a little relief on Monday. The air quality is still bad but at least I am not getting much trouble in breathing.”

Meanwhile, the AQI at Muzaffarpur and Gaya were 184 and 99 respectively.

66,['21/01/2020'],Sachin Bansal to put $400 million in banking business,"Sachin Bansal (File photo)

BENGALURU: Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal has said that he will deploy all the proceeds from the sale of his stake in the e-commerce player into his financial services venture Navi Technologies , which has applied for a universal banking licence with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The financial services firm has sought the licence through a step-down subsidiary.Bansal could likely invest $400-450 million in the new venture, according to estimates, which will likely make it one of the biggest equity infusions by a promoter into a new financial services venture. “I am putting almost all of mine (money) — that is going to happen in the next few days or weeks, whatever is left after Ola investment. All eggs in one basket,” said Bansal in an interview to TOI, while not commenting on exact numbers. The total amount is likely to be invested in multiple tranches.The 38-year-old IIT-Delhi graduate, who had started Flipkart in 2007, is also adding more heft to his new venture by roping in former RBI director and ICICI Bank top executive Nachiket Mor, who was till recently head of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in India. He has also roped in as an adviser Paresh Sukthankar, the former deputy to HDFC Bank CEO Aditya Puri , who had worked at India’s largest private sector lender since its inception in 1994.Bansal had agreed to sell his over 5% stake in Flipkart to US retail giant Walmart in 2018 for about $1 billion, out of which he will get $750-800 million after tax. Out of this, Bansal has invested $300-350 million in companies like ride-hailing major Ola and electric bike maker Ather. He has also put some capital in treasury operations, including debt papers of companies like Piramal Enterprises.According to Bansal, regulators are “very open to new ideas” and the reason why he has applied for a universal licence rather than a small finance bank is that he wants to operate across multiple sectors.“If you think like a consumer tech company rather than a traditional financial services company, you can solve some big problems,” said Bansal. He added that for India to become a $5-trillion economy, the GDP-to-credit ratio has to improve to 100% from the current 57%.Last year, Bansal had acquired microfinance company Chaitanya Rural Intermediation Development Services (CRIDS), whose subsidiary Chaitanya India Fin Credit (CIFCPL) has applied for the banking licence. While Bansal had acquired CRIDS in his personal capacity, he is in the process of moving the investment under Navi Technologies. The last two players to get a universal banking licence in India were IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank, who had applied in 2013 along with 23 others and got an in-principle nod after 10-11 months in 2014.“We will keep the smartphone at the centre of consumer experience, rather than an add-on,” Bansal said. He indicated that currently, it’s the other way round with branches being the centre of focus, and mobile apps also crash at the start of the month, underlining how there is a gap in technology capability at big players. While Chaitanya will continue to focus on the lower end of the market, Bansal also plans to launch a new product under the Navi brand, which will focus on digital lending for the middle-class.Banking through digital channels has been growing at a record pace. According to RBI data, from September 2018 to October 2019, retail digital transactions by value saw a jump of 21% at Rs 302 lakh crore compared to around Rs 250 crore in a year-ago period. Bansal is also in the process of acquiring DHFL Insurance and Essel Mutual Fund to develop plays in the insurance and asset management plays.Both deals are yet to receive regulatory approvals. Bansal said that Navi will raise additional capital from three-four outside investors, including World Bank arm IFC, which is investing $30 million at a valuation of $650-700 million, as TOI reported on January 10. In total, Bansal could be raising $150-200 million from outside investors, according to two sources, though Bansal declined to comment on numbers.“We are looking for people who bring that expertise (financial services). IFC is definitely one of those names. In the 1980s, they were the first investor in HDFC, not the bank but HDFC Ltd. They were investors in almost all the banks who got a licence. So, they have tremendous experience in building banks, not just in India but outside India also. Not just banks but for insurance companies, stock markets in Africa. So, that’s a great set of capabilities we get access to,” he added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73469135,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128681,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sachin-bansal-to-put-400m-in-banking-biz/articleshow/73452772.cms

68,['21/01/2020'],ashok leyland: Truck &amp; bus makers expect rise in demand on back of BSVI pre-buying,"CHENNAI: The truck and bus market, which has been battered by slowdown in sales, is seeing some revival particularly in tipper and medium duty intermediate trucks as well as bus segments.According to commercial vehicle marketers, a combination of factors including pre-buying, infrastructure spending and e-commerce boom have all contributed to the trend.Said Anuj Kathuria, COO, Ashok Leyland : “In the first 9 months of the fiscal, trucks are down 42% but buses are doing better. Our bus volumes are up 20% and we have gained 5% marketshare due to big orders from some state transport units including Tamil Nadu.” As for intermediate or medium duty trucks, that segment, has fared better all through because “it was not hit by the change in axle norms”.Part of the trend is fuelled by pre-buying before the March 31 deadline for BSVI.Said Vinod Aggarwal , MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles: “This quarter there is going to be pre-buying before the BS6 price hikes. Also February-June is the time when schools buy buses. Some big fleet operators have also started buying but are driving hard bargains and some replacement demand is also trickling in,” he added.What has helped sentiment, particularly in medium truck segment, is the boom in e-commerce segment. This is also prompting truck companies to customize their aggregates for more durability because of higher usage.Trucks normally do 10,000-12,000 km a month but e-comm fleet runs 20,000-25,000 km a month and sometimes go up to 40,000 km too.Said Satyakam Arya, MD & CEO, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV): “E- commerce segment is highly time- sensitive. Two key deciding factors for customers in this segment are reliability and faster turn-around time. The e- commerce trucks also require more value added features like cameras, security and connectivity. E- commerce industry in India is expected to touch $ 65 billion in 2020 and we will definitely participate in this growing market offering more customized solutions.”The customised solutions include fuel options too. Said VECV's Aggarwal: “Some shorter routes like Delhi-Jaipur or Delhi-Chandigarh are using CNG trucks. The new generation trucks are designed to be driven more. Apart from durability, cabin comfort also ensures 2x or even 3x usage.”As for tippers, here the government announcements on infrastructure spending has brought some cheer. “Tippers were stuck because payments were stuck but now with government focus on infrastructure, things could start moving,” said Kathuria.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73489535,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2334809,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/truck-bus-makers-expect-rise-in-demand-on-back-of-bs6-pre-buying/articleshow/73489620.cms

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank has reported a net profit of Rs 1,595 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 — an increase of 23% over Rs 1,290 crore in the same period of the previous year.

During this quarter, profits were contained because of a one-time employee cost towards pension obligation of Rs 200 crore. Dipak Gupta, joint MD of the bank, said the lender had to set aside additional funds towards pension for employees of erstwhile ING Vysya Bank. Kotak Bank has 2,000 serving employees and 3,000 retired staff, who are eligible for pension. “We had to deposit more funds after LIC reduced the returns under its annuity to 6.9% from 7.9%,” said Gupta.

The bank’s net interest income (NII) for Q3FY20 rose to Rs 3,430 crore from Rs 2,926 crore in Q3FY19, up 17%. Net interest margin (NIM) for Q3FY20 was at 4.69%, up from 4.31% in Q3FY19. At the end of the quarter, the bank’s advances rose 9% to Rs 2.13 lakh crore from Rs 1.96 lakh crore in the corresponding quarter of previous year. Deposits grew 12% to Rs 2.39 lakh crore from Rs 2.13 lakh crore a year ago.

“There is only so much that we can grow our loans, when the economy is growing a nominal rate of 7-8%,” said Gupta. He cautioned against growing unsecured loans stating risks play out only after a couple of years. He added that defaults could rise sharply in this segment if there were job losses.

On consolidated basis, the profit increased 27% to Rs 2,349 crore as compared to Rs 1,844 crore in the same period a year ago. Total income rose to Rs 13,542 crore from Rs 11,347 crore in the third quarter of FY19. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at the quarter-end rose to 2.46% of the total advances as compared with 2.07% at the end of the third quarter of FY19. Net NPAs too increased to 0.89% of the assets in October-December 2019, against 0.71% a year ago.

Chennai: Ashok Leyland is investing around Rs 500 crore on a new platform as well the transition to BS6. This includes around Rs 300 to Rs 350 crore on the new modular platform on which it plans to roll out its BS6 range, said a top company official.

“Ashok Leyland is bringing a completely new platform for BS6,” said company COO Anuj Kathuria. “BS6 requires more complex electricals and electronics and the new platform will allow us to position every aggregate in an optional way,” he added. The new platform has been developed ‘indigenously’. The truck and bus maker, will stop producing BS4 vehicles from February and will only make them based on specific customer requirements in an effort to keep inventory levels manageable in the run up to BS6 migration.

“From February onwards, BS4 models will only be made to order,” said Kathuria. “Our BS4 pipeline is very manageable and we’re not in a position where we will have to push BS4 stock. We will continue producting BS4 vehicles depending on specific customer requirements.”

With BS4 vehicle registration stopping on March 31, any leftover aggregates will have several option of being cleared out. “We will use them to cater to after market requirements and to service export markets that are not yet BS6 compliant,” said Kathuria. “Our entire supply chain is being streamlined as is our distribution network,” he added. Ashok Leyland’s BS6 range, will use a combination of iEGR (intelligent exhaust gas recirculation) and SCR (selective catalytic reduction) for India’s largely stop-and-go traffic.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Monday said a statue of Maharana Pratap would be installed in the state capital.

Addressing a public meeting organized at the Miller School ground to remember Maharana Pratap on his death anniversary, Nitish said, “We will be doing all the necessary works to honour our illustrious personalities. We have done several works for development of all sections of the society. We have done development works in all regions of the state and for all strata of the society with our resolve to do ‘development with justice’. Several schemes have been launched to bring the disadvantaged sections to the mainstream of the society.”

Earlier, JD(U) spokesperson and former MLC Sanjay Singh demanded installation of a statue of Maharana Pratap in the state capital.

CM further called upon people to follow the path shown by the Maharana to ensure justice to all and peace and togetherness in the society.

Recalling the great valour of the hero of Haldighati, Nitish said Maharana Pratap engaged in long and intermittent fight against the then Mughal regime, but it could be possible because he took people from all sections of the society along with him. The Maharana gave due respect to the people from minorities and tribal communities and they supported him in his war against the Mughals. Members of Dalit Bhangar community were inducted in his army.

The CM also assured the audience to do what he can to help the jailed former MP Anand Mohan.

Other prominent leaders who addressed the event and recalled the contributions of Maharana Pratap were JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narain Singh, Lok Sabha member Rajiv Ranjan Singh, science and technology minister Jai Kumar Singh, building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, water resources minister Sanjay Jha, rural development minister Shravan Kumar, I&PRD minister Neeraj Kumar and former minister Lesie Singh.

Yuva JD(U) spokesperson Om Prakash Singh Setu proposed a vote of thanks.

MUZAFFARPUR: The Central Excise and Customs Department sleuths recovered betel nuts worth over Rs 1.25 crore from two trucks near Maithi toll plaza on NH-57 under Gaighat police station late Sunday evening.

The trucks were intercepted at Jarang village, around 100 metres from the toll plaza. Sources said the trucks were coming from Nepal and had crossed the border near Jainagar in Madhubani district. The consignment was being smuggled from Myanmar and Vietnam, sources said.

Deputy commissioner (customs) Sunil Kumar Gautam said two persons were detained in this connection. “We got some specific information about the trucks bearing the registration numbers of Nagaland. The trucks were laden with betel nuts and on way to Patna. We detained the drivers and cleaners of the trucks, but they were released on personal bond after interrogation. They have given us some vital clues about the illegal trade. They have also revealed the names of few men involved in this trade,” he said, adding that the estimated marked value of the consignment is more than Rs1.25 crore.

“The drivers and cleaners of the trucks were quizzed at our Patna office. They said they were given a mobile number of a person in Patna. But, that number is switched off,” said Gautam.

KOLKATA: Veteran theatre personality Bibhas Chakraborty, who was the chief guest at the Founders’ Day celebrations at Presidency University on Monday, said there should be a “gana vote”, “plebiscite” or “referendum” before a law like the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and the proposed National Population Register ( NPR ) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) are implemented. He was speaking on the sidelines of the institution’s 203rd Founders’ Day celebrations on the College Street campus.

“Gana vote hok (let there be mass voting on this issue), plebiscite hok, referendum hok. A law like CAA cannot be passed without consulting the citizens. There should have been wider consultations with the people of the country before such a law was even formulated. After all, it impacts all of us,” the former Presidency student said.

“We have been protesting from various forums and will continue to do so. They claim that they have won with 38% vote of the people of this country. But, so what? A democracy does not function like this. Somebody getting 38% vote cannot decide the fate of the entire country. It is just like partition, where some people sitting in Delhi decided to divide the country and millions were displaced overnight. What is happening now in India is similar to that. Let there be a referendum,” he said.

Chakraborty, along with several other former students, put their names on a board set up by the students to collect signatures against CAA, NRC and NPR.

Former home secretary of Bengal Prasad Ranjan Ray said the opposition parties in the country had failed to put up resistance against CAA and NRC.

“I don’t comment on political matters, but this issue has forced me to voice my concerns. We don’t know on what trajectory this will take the country. For my generation, it is impossible to provide the sort of legacy documents that are needed. I feel the opposition parties are unable to unite and stand against this,” he added.

78,['21/01/2020'],ashok leyland: Truck &amp; bus makers expect rise in demand on back of BSVI pre-buying,"This story is from January 21, 2020

CHENNAI: The truck and bus market, which has been battered by slowdown in sales, is seeing some revival particularly in tipper and medium duty intermediate trucks as well as bus segments.

According to commercial vehicle marketers, a combination of factors including pre-buying, infrastructure spending and e-commerce boom have all contributed to the trend.

Said Anuj Kathuria, COO, Ashok Leyland : “In the first 9 months of the fiscal, trucks are down 42% but buses are doing better. Our bus volumes are up 20% and we have gained 5% marketshare due to big orders from some state transport units including Tamil Nadu.” As for intermediate or medium duty trucks, that segment, has fared better all through because “it was not hit by the change in axle norms”.

Part of the trend is fuelled by pre-buying before the March 31 deadline for BSVI.

Said Vinod Aggarwal , MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles: “This quarter there is going to be pre-buying before the BS6 price hikes. Also February-June is the time when schools buy buses. Some big fleet operators have also started buying but are driving hard bargains and some replacement demand is also trickling in,” he added.

What has helped sentiment, particularly in medium truck segment, is the boom in e-commerce segment. This is also prompting truck companies to customize their aggregates for more durability because of higher usage.

Trucks normally do 10,000-12,000 km a month but e-comm fleet runs 20,000-25,000 km a month and sometimes go up to 40,000 km too.

Said Satyakam Arya, MD & CEO, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV): “E- commerce segment is highly time- sensitive. Two key deciding factors for customers in this segment are reliability and faster turn-around time. The e- commerce trucks also require more value added features like cameras, security and connectivity. E- commerce industry in India is expected to touch $ 65 billion in 2020 and we will definitely participate in this growing market offering more customized solutions.”

The customised solutions include fuel options too. Said VECV's Aggarwal: “Some shorter routes like Delhi-Jaipur or Delhi-Chandigarh are using CNG trucks. The new generation trucks are designed to be driven more. Apart from durability, cabin comfort also ensures 2x or even 3x usage.”

As for tippers, here the government announcements on infrastructure spending has brought some cheer. “Tippers were stuck because payments were stuck but now with government focus on infrastructure, things could start moving,” said Kathuria.

Thiruvananthapuram: The six-km road from the domestic terminal (T1) of Trivandrum International Airport to Chackai Junction will get a facelift soon as Rs 13 crore has been approved for the project.

The road, which will also pass through one of the entrance gates of the international terminal (T2), will be developed in international standards, giving aesthetic elements equal prominence as for other components like standard ducts for cables, disabled-friendly footpaths and proper pedestrian crossing points.

The road has been conceived as a ‘waste-free zone’ in a bid to address concerns regarding possible bird hits .

As waste is piling up at many points along the road, the number of birds in the region is high, increasing the risk of bird hits.

On Monday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan convened a meeting to discuss the proposal.

Along with senior officials, representatives of Thiruvananthapuram Road Development Company Limited (TRDCL) - the concessionaire of City Roads Improvement Project - also attended the meeting.

As per the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by TRDCL, surveillance cameras will be installed at every 30 metres along the road. The fund for the same will be sourced from the public works department’s (PWD) budget allocation.

As per the plan, beautification work will be taken up along the stretch. Landscaping work will also be taken up. Flowering plants and small trees will be planted in the area.

Sculptures that will be mark the culture and heritage of Kerala will be installed in available spaces.

“Dumping of waste in the area is a major concern. The surveillance cameras will help to keep a check on this,” said an official from the Kerala road fund board.

The annual maintenance cost of the road is estimated around Rs 2.5 crore.

Once the beautification work of the road is completed, it is planned to raise the amount for maintenance through sponsors and advertising.

The meeting also reviewed the progress of restoration work of the Shanghumugham Road. A tender of Rs 5 crore has been invited for the restoration of the damaged area of Shangumugham Road.

A 200-metre stretch, along with the beach area, was damaged during soil erosion few months ago. The work will be started in February.

General administration principal secretary K R Jyothilal, local self-government department additional chief secretary T K Jose, PWD principal secretary R K Singh and principal secretary to CM V S Senthil attended the meeting.

83,['21/01/2020'],Manic Monday: City marches to a halt,"This story is from January 21, 2020

New Delhi: The arterial roads in central Delhi were choked on Monday afternoon owing to back-to-back roadshows, rallies and protest marches.

While southeast Delhi is already under siege due to the closure of Kalindi Kunj road, traffic being diverted through Noida Link Road and DND Flyway was also stalled during peak hours. The worst impacted was Vikas Marg between 11am and 1pm.

The snarls started around 1pm when supporters of Aam Aadmi Party gathered at Mandi House and Connaught Place Outer Circle for a protest march and a roadshow. Police shut one carriageway of Sikandra Road and a portion of Outer Circle from Minto Road for the rallies.

As a result, traffic jams started building up on Sikandra Road, DDU Marg and Minto Road. The ripple effect of the jam reached ITO within an hour. Soon, police shut Outer Ring Road and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg for VIP movement from Talkatora Stadium to the BJP office on DDU Marg.

Since ITO crossing had to be closed for 15 minutes for the VIPs to pass, the snarl reached Vikas Marg and Noida Link Road even as police tried to clear the vehicles accumulated on the stretch. “I was stuck on Vikas Marg for nearly 40 minutes around 3pm before I could reach ITO for work,” said Devika Bhalla, a resident of Noida.

Commuters tweeted about the snarls tagging the traffic police. Police said they had to control the traffic signals manually.

A senior police officer said that the increase in volume of traffic from Noida added to the mess. According to an estimate, there has been a 20% increase in the number of vehicles that earlier used the south Delhi stretches to enter the city from Noida. As a result, nearly 40,000 vehicles are added to the existing volume at ITO, which is the busiest intersection in the city.

With the Kalindi Kunj road closed, motorists take Noida Link Road during peak hours to reach central and south Delhi to avoid the snarls on DND Flyway and Barapullah road.

Construction activities at crucial intersections like Ashram and Bhairon Marg add to the chaos.

Malappuram: Mystery shrouds the death of the elder sister of four girls who were sexually abused by their father at Valanchery in the district.

On Saturday, Valanchery police had arrested the 47-year-old man for sexually abusing his four daughters aged 17, 15, 13 and 10. The children who have been sheltered in a child care institute informed counselors that their elder sister had died six years ago at the age of 15.

An official of social welfare department has revealed that they would discuss the issue with senior police officials at an official meeting on Tuesday and would ask the special police team conducting a probe into the sexual abuse case to also investigate the death.

Official sources said that a detailed probe into the death of the girl is needed as all other girls of the family were victims of abuse by the father. “During various counseling sessions, the survivors revealed that their elder sister died due to illness without giving details of the reason for death,” said the official.

District Child Protection Officer Geethanjali said that it was the police’s duty to conduct an investigation if there anything mysterious in the death of the elder sister of the victims of Valanchery sexual abuse case.

Meanwhile, Valanchery police inspector T Manoharan, who is leading the investigation team, said that they have no information on an elder sister of the girls.

85,['21/01/2020'],Osmania University prof Kaseem is first Dalit secretary of Virasam,"This story is from January 21, 2020

HYDERABAD: The Viplava Rachayitala Sangham (Revolutionary Writers’ Association), popularly known as Virasam, was much in news following the arrest of its secretary and associate professor in Osmania University Ch Kaseem . Virasam has nearly 50 years of literary legacy, having engaged in the development of Telugu literature and carrying out literary activities in support of various people’s movements, including the Srikakulam Struggle in ’70s and the Telangana statehood agitation.

The journey of Virasam began in the port city of Visakhapatnam on July 4, 1970. The establishment of Virasam was one of the major events in Telugu literary world revolving around Sri Sri (Srirangam Srinivasa Rao), who is considered as the ‘poet of this century’ and ‘Mahakavi’ (greatest poet) in Telugu.

Resentment was brewing among many young poets as the most noted literature platform ‘Abhyudaya Rachiyitala Sangham’ (Arasam) was being seen by many as being status quoist and pro-state.

By then, many literature lovers, specially in poetry, were under the influence of developments in France and other European countries. In 1970, when Sri Sri was attending a felicitation event in Visakhapatnam, many young poets objected to him saying that he was not ‘pro-people’ when Srikakulam Struggle was at its peak. In July in the same year, Seven Stars Collective, a private organisation wanted to felicitate Sri Sri in Hyderabad, which again faced revolt from young poets.

It led to the birth of Virasam with poets and writers of different schools of thought like ‘digambara kavulu’ (naked poets), ‘tirugubatu kavulu’ (poets who revolt) and all those who were opposed to then literary establishment.

Sri Sri also joined Virasam and was made the first president of Virasam. C Narayana Reddy, who won the Jnanpith award for his poetry compilation ‘Viswambhara,’ was part of the organisation which wanted to facilitate Sri Sri in Hyderabad, but he did not join Virasam.

Critics of Virasam then said Sri Sri was kidnapped, to which Sri Sri famously responded: “No one kidnapped me, but revolution kidnapped me.” It was during this time, a poetry compilation of Virasam ‘Ipudu veestunna gaali’ (The wind of present times) was banned.

Virasam was very active during the Emergency. The organisation was banned for some time in the ’90s and some of its sympathisers were either killed by rivals and gunned down in police encounters. One among them was Paritala Sriramulu, father of slain Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Paritala Ravindra.

Virasam had a legion of stalwarts of Telugu literature like C Kutumba Rao and Raavi Shastri under its wings. However, many of them left Virasam alleging that it was not providing space and freedom to new thoughts of literary identity and to Dalits and women.

Virasam, on its part, refutes the allegations of police of allegiance to Maoist party and says it would continue to operate in the fields of art and literature.

Virasam publishes at least 20 books every year, including translation works from other languages. “Our stand on key issues has not changed. We will continue to focus on literature which inspires people,” Arasvilli Krishna, who is the new president-elect of Virasam, said.

In fact, after Sri Sri, Virasam never had a full-time president. P Varavara Rao , who is lodged in a Pune jail in a case relating to alleged conspiracy to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continues to be the face of Virasam. Kaseem is the first Dalit secretary of the organisation.

Kochi: Kochi corporation council held on Monday failed to overcome the hurdles in front of many of the SmartCity projects . So, the special meeting of the council convened to discuss issues related to the implementation of component projects of SmartCity decided to rope in the state government.

Mayor Soumini Jain said the council will seek the intervention of local self-government minister A C Moideen to tackle the issues related to implementation of the projects. She also instructed Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) officials to send a report to the corporation regarding when the road renovation projects under SmartCity can be started and completed. “The CSML officials should send the report immediately so that it can be placed before the council when it meets next,” Jain said.

The corporation failed to sort out the issues related to identifying land for rehabilitating merchants from Ernakulam Market as part of its renovation. At a meeting convened by Hibi Eden, MP, in August 2019, a school near the market was identified for rehabilitating the merchants. Later, it came to the fore that the land of the school is entangled in a legal dispute over ownership. “We held discussion with the owners. They are ready to hand over the land provided we return it in good condition within the said period. Now, we are planning to move the court,” a CSML official said. “As part of the project, we have two works. One is the reconstruction of the market building. The second one is the construction of a temporary set up for rehabilitating the merchants. If there is no solution to get the land of the school, we will have to put the second work on hold,” he said.

According to the officials with CSML, work on 18 projects worth Rs 592 crore was started while nine projects totalling to Rs 38.56 crore are in the final stage of tendering. While other agencies would be entrusted with the implementation of five projects worth Rs 57.03 crore through nomination scheme, another five projects costing Rs 77.5 crore would be implemented in association with other departments and agencies. Five projects worth Rs 205.4 crore will be awarded in January itself.

The mayor has asked the CMSL officials to expedite implementation of the projects like installation of CCTV cameras and road signage in the city. “There won’t be much difficulties in implementing such projects. So, those projects should be implemented on a war footing,” she said.

K J Antony, the opposition leader of Kochi corporation, slammed the authorities for delaying the project.

The audio clip has shown true colour of Congress and its leaders to the people,” alleged Bhasin.

Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni, while questioning the authenticity of the audio clip, said, “BJP must ponder on the leaked audio clips of their members before pointing a finger at us. Our party will decide on further action only after the authenticity of the clip is proved.” She added that such issues could be resolved easily after the appointment of a Lokayukta in the state and that the Congress has been demanding for the same for a long time now.

In the audio clip, a man can be heard asking an aspiring zila panchyat member to “teach a lesson to Brahmins for voting in favour of the BJP.” The clip is said to have been recorded around the recently-held panchayat polls.

When queried on the issue, Bhandari denied making any provocative statements. ""The leaked audio clip is tampered and has been made viral to malign my image,"" the Congress leader alleged.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Just when the state health authorities had written off dengue as a threat and a dip in number of cases were being seen, the dengue spreading Aedes mosquitoes seem to have become active again. In January, 180 new cases have been detected across the state.

Although January is not the dengue season and up till two years ago barely one or two stray cases were reported during this time of the year, dengue has clearly become an all season virus as indicated by experts. Last year, cases were reported throughout the year and the number increased substantially during monsoon season.

With dengue becoming a constant threat, experts say it’s time that government start investing in research related to dengue. “Several countries are carrying out research programmes to find ways to deal with the problem. For instance, Singapore is doing research on releasing dummy mosquitoes in the atmosphere to cut out the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes. We also need to look at the research aspect now. Moreover, despite such huge number of cases reported last year, not a single hoarding or flexi, creating awareness about the disease, was put up anywhere in the city. We need to create awareness and take drastic steps towards it,” said Dr M Karuna, paediatrician who had filed a PIL in the High Court over inaction of authorities to control dengue.

The need for focussing on preventive aspect becomes important as dengue is a costly disease. “Being a viral infection there is no specific treatment for dengue and only symptomatic treatment is given. In severe cases, several organs get affected and multi-organ failure is common, which requires ICU care. As a result the cost outcome is huge and yet there is only little chance of survival in severe cases,” said a senior official from state health department.

As per state health department, 13,417 dengue cases were recorded across Telangana in 2019. This is the highest number of cases reported in the state till date and has seen the highest jump in number of cases year-on-year (from 4,592 cases in 2018 to 13,417 in 2019).

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan releases Kerala Bank logo in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Kerala Bank is an alternative to those banks which are exploiting people with profit motives. He was speaking after releasing the logo of Kerala Bank here on Monday.

There is no doubt that Kerala Bank will become the premier banking institution in the state. At present SBI is the premier banking institution in the state with 1,216 branches and a total deposit of Rs 1,53,000 crore. Kerala Bank will have 825 branches and a total deposit of Rs 65,000 crore. Apart from this there will be cooperatives in the farming sector. This network will protect the interests of people and will be a lifeline for the poor. In the next three years the aim is to create a deposit worth Rs 3 lakh crore, said the chief minister.

He allayed the fears created from certain quarters that the cooperative behaviour of the cooperative banks will be lost once the Kerala Bank is formed. “The cooperative behaviour will be protected and people will be benefitted in the same way the cooperative banks have been catering to their needs,” he said.

The first general body meeting of the Kerala State Cooperative Bank has given the approval for the merger of 13 district cooperative banks for the formation of the Kerala Bank. The general body also gave nod for the mission document of the bank and for the business plan that has to be executed in the next three years.

Cooperative minister Kadakampally Surendran said the general body was attended by 987 representatives. He claimed that the boycott called by the UDF was disowned by their supporters and they attended the meeting.

ALLAHABAD: Special Task Force (STF) arrested four men, including two servicemen, for their alleged involvement in an Army recruitment racket near Company Garden on Monday.

Police also seized three forged admit cards, applicants’ educational documents, financial records, eight mobile phones along with 229 odd WhatsApp screenshots and Rs 2.75 lakh cash from them. The accused were identified as Pradeep Singh Yadav from Ghazipur Sanjay Kumar Pandey from Kushinagar, Manish Singh Yadav from Kushinagar and Tripthinath Saroj from Jaunpur.

Of these Pradeep and Sanjay were Armymen. While Pradeep worked as a fire engine driver at COD Cheoki, Sanjay was posted as a nayak at 6 Mahar Regiment at Karu-Leh.

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “The accused used to ensure appointment of candidates to Indian Army by forging medical records and other documents and helping them fraudulently clear the recruitment process.”

“During interrogation, Manish told police that his cousin and Kaushambi resident Mulayam Singh Yadav alias Ajay Yadav was the kingpin of the gang and is with the Indian Army. He is currently posted in Jodhpur,” Pandey said.

The ASP said the accused used to charge candidates Rs 60,000 to ensure that they clear the medical tests which are a part of the recruitment process. “If the candidate was successfully appointed, then they would charge an extra Rs 2-2.5 lakh.” STF claimed that kingpin of the racket Ajay Yadav had a close associate in zonal recruitment office (ZRO) in Lucknow who used to provide them official documents.

It was reported that two of the gang’s members – Pradeep Singh Yadav and Manish Yadav- had handed over Rs 25 lakh to a clerk posted at ZRO near Charbagh station in Lucknow last year.

The racketeers admittedmany military hospitals in Allahabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Meerut and Army officials were a part of the nexus

A case has been lodged with Civil Lines police station under sections 419, and 420 of IPC and section 7\13 of the Corruption Eradication Act.

T’puram: Retired high court judge Justice B Kemal Pasha urged the anti-CAA protesters to abstain themselves from using provocative and religious slogans.

“It is true that Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been implemented against Muslims. But, before we protest against this unconstitutional Act, it is really important that we abstain from provocative and religious sloganeering. With CAA, they are attacking the secular nature of this country. We must form an alliance which is forged in friendship, we need the support of all the secular forces in our country to resist CAA and the implementation of NRC,” he said while inaugurating the Camaraderie Meet as part of the MahalFest held here on Monday.

Justice Pasha strongly condemned the provocative and offensive sloganeering in the protests and cautioned that religious extremists are making use of this opportunity to strengthen their hold.

“Many people may not like what I am about to say. But what is the relevance of speaking about the violence occurred in the communal riots in the past at the protest gatherings against CAA? It will only further divide the gap between our communities. The ruling party came unto power using communal polarization and they are very successful at doing so. We should not fall for that again and we must isolate extremists among ourselves. Extremism does not have a religion, be it Hindu or Muslim, extremists are extremists,” he added.

Justice Pasha also urged the people to seek the help of judiciary in the fight against CAA and NRC.

Palayam Imam V P Shuhaib Moulavi, state president of Jama-at Council Karamana Bayar and former director of minority department P Naseer also spoke at the function.

Representative image

KOCHI: Fitness certificates of stage carriages fitted with high-intensity after-market headlights, thereby posing danger to other road users, should be cancelled, the high court has ordered. Similar action should be taken for vehicles with unauthorized crash guards or bull bars, the court directed.

Justice Anil K Narendran issued the order to the transport commissioner and motor vehicle department after considering two petitions on stage carriages violating the law. A stage carriage runs between two places without any prior contract and passengers can board or get down in between by paying only for the distance they travel. Thus, it would include KSRTC and private buses, and does not include tourist buses.

Making the transport commissioner a party in the cases, the court directed, “The Transport Commissioner, Kerala shall take necessary steps to ensure through the concerned officers in the Motor Vehicles Department that no stage carriage, including vehicles older than 20 years from the date of its registration, which are not installed with lighting and light-signalling devices and also retro-reflectors referred to in Para. 6.0 of AIS-008, conforming to the individual specifications for such lighting and light-signalling devices and also for retro-reflectors prescribed in Paras. 6.1 to 6.20, namely number, position, width, height, length, geometric visibility, orientation, etc; or which are installed with lighting and light-signalling devices or retro-reflectors other than those referred to in Para.6.0, which are likely to endanger the safety of other road users, are being permitted to be used in any public place.”

Such vehicles should not be issued fitness certificates and if any issued, should be cancelled, the court ordered. Proceedings should be initiated against the driver of such vehicle, including disqualification of licence for three months, and the owner of such vehicle should also be proceeded against, the order stated.

The court also ordered action against stage carriages fitted with after-market crash guards, bull bars and footsteps.

Action should also be taken against stage carriages not displaying the registration number’ without the illuminating lamp for rear registration plate; tampering with percentage of visual transmission of light of windscreen, rear and side windows by pasting stickers, tint films, etc; hanging various objects in front of the windscreen, thereby obstructing the driver’s clear vision, the court directed.

The court also ordered that action should be taken against use of graphical stickers on the body of stage carriages. “The body of every stage carriage shall be soundly constructed, as per the mandate of Rule 261 of Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, and the paintwork or varnish shall be maintained in a clean and sound condition and in accordance with the specifications laid down by the State/Regional Transport Authority, as per the mandate of Rule 264 of the said Rules,” the order said.

KOTA: Unidentified assailants on Monday early morning robbed a 32-year-old woman of her mangalsutra and earrings and when she resisted, they stoned her to death outside her house in Growth Centre area of Jhalrapatan . The deceased’s husband had left the house around 3.30am on Monday while her two children were asleep in the room at the time of crime.

Police have lodged a case of loot and murder under sections of IPC against unidentified accused. The body was handed over to family members after post-mortem. The deceased woman was identified as Sonabai Meghwal, wife of Radheshyam, said sub-inspector at Jhalrapatan police station Komal Pradas.

Prima facie, it seems that the unidentified accused entered the house between 3.30-4.30am after her husband left the house to collect cow dung. The children were asleep in the room, the SI said.

The deceased probably resisted the loot bid following which the accused attacked her with a heavy stone causing fatal injuries over her head, back and stomach, Pradas added. The deceased’s mangalsutra and earrings were missing.

Ranthambore tiger T-25 named Zalim, which came into limelight for its unusual behaviour of rearing two motherless cubs, died in a suspected territorial fight

The tiger was often spotted with the orphaned cubs, looking after them since they were four-months old

Second death of tiger in park in the last four months

JAIPUR: Ranthambore tiger T-25 named Zalim, which came into limelight for its unusual behaviour of rearing two motherless cubs, died in a suspected territorial fight on Monday.The carcass of the tiger was found near Jarkhala nalla in Sanwata area of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR). After the post-mortem, the forest department has concluded that the death occurred in a territorial fight.Mukesh Saini, divisional forest officer (DFO), Ranthambore National Park (RNP) said, “The tiger had two injuries on its head. It was found to have two canine marks above the eyes. It appears that the big cat died in the territorial fight with 10-year-old tiger T-66 whose movement was recorded with tigress T-54 in the same area.”“Tiger T-25’s behaviour of taking care and raising cubs to adulthood was unique and it has never been seen or filmed before this incident,” the official said.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressed grief over the death of T-25, reportedly the first documented tiger to play “father figure”.“Sad news for wildlife that Ranthambore’s famous tiger T-25 is no more. It was a magnanimous tiger which took care of two orphan cubs, displaying fatherly instincts to raise and protect them to the surprise of conservationists. T-25 will be missed,” Gehlot tweeted.In 2012, the tiger took care of the twin orphan cubs of tigress T-5. This was one of the first instances when experts found a male tiger, known to abandon cubs after birth, playing the role of a ‘mother’, something unheard of about tigers.The tiger was often spotted with the orphaned cubs, looking after them since they were four-months old.In the past four months, this is the second death of a big cat in the park from territorial fights. Three- year-old T-109 named Veeru was found with 35 wounds in October last year.Cramped in an area of 392 sq km of core area with a 1,342 sq km buffer zone, it has been extremely difficult for big cats to find adequate space in the reserve, which is bursting at its seams due to increasing population.Pushed to the periphery of the reserve, it’s a tough choice for them to either fight with dominants, create space for themselves or stray into human habitation.Dinesh Verma Durani, founder and general secretary of Sariska Tiger Foundation and a member of the advisory committee, said, “The forest department claims that no new male tigers can be relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) as the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has refused to approve proposals of fresh relocation after a male tiger died in April. It was a natural death. Since then, two tigers have died in Ranthambore. The department should strongly present their case at NTCA to save tigers by moving them to Sariska.”",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73470736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-794422,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/first-documented-male-tiger-toplay-mom-to-2-cubs-dead-in-rtr/articleshow/73453340.cms

Representative image

JAIPUR: Now, those aspiring to be pilots need not go out of the state for training. The Rajasthan State Flying School in Jaipur, one-of-its-kind in the state, is being revived to train aspiring pilots after a gap of about 11 years.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who is also the president of the governing council of the flying school, has given his nod. Flying school has been in a limbo for over a decade after it was hit by various irregularities in issuing commercial pilot licence.

Kesari Singh, director, civil aviation said, “The chief minister has given his nod. We will shortly convene a governing council meeting to formally endorse the proposal.”

On being asked about the facilities available at the flying school, he said at present the flying school has two planes and a motor glider to train aspiring pilots. “We have a Cessna 172 four-seater plane and Cessna 152 two-seater plane. The school also plans two more planes soon.” He said according to the plan, a batch of 20 students has been decided upond initially.

The state government had earlier also made efforts to revive the school but did not succeed. Sources added that the state government will have to go for various licences before giving a nod to start the flying school.

The flying school hit headlines in 2008 when the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) exposed a scam when one of the trainees of the school, Nidhi Vashishtha, approached the bureau claiming that she was trained only for 22 hours but the chief flying officer Mahendra Chaudhary mentioned 169 hours of flying in the school record and sent it to DGCA.

During investigation, names of 14 pilots had come up who were issued flying certificates through dubious means by chief flying inspector of the school at the Sanganer airport. These certificates were used by the pilots to get commercial pilot licences (CPL) from DGCA. Similar arrests were made in Delhi and Haryana.

101,['21/01/2020'],Government interest crucial in Tamil Nadu’s biggest fest,"This story is from January 21, 2020

During Thai Poosam, the six abodes of Murugan in Tamil Nadu records a combined footfall of more than 3 crore

(K K Ramchandran)

Pongal is more of a cultural event than a religious one, traditionally a harvest occasion celebrated by people across society. So, Thai Poosam , which is celebrated on the last day of the festivities and which has Lord Muruga, the Tamil god of youth, beauty and aggression Lord Muruga at its centre, should rightfully be accorded the tag of the biggest religious event of Tamils.

Though celebrated for 10 days with yatra, kavadi and milk pot (paal kudam) processions, the fervour peaks over the last three days and culminates when Tamil month of Thai blends with Poosam star. This year, it falls on January 21.

From Kandy in Sri Lanka to Batu caves of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, nothing unites the Tamil diaspora as passionately as Thai Poosam. Batu caves logged 1.6 million visitors on Thai Poosam day in 2019, and this year the number is expected to breach the two million mark. Every year, during this period, the six abodes of Lord Muruga in Tamil Nadu records a combined footfall of more than 3 crore. And, the pre-Christian era hill shrine of Palani alone accounts for more than a third of the crowd. The once-in-40-years spectacle of Athi Varadar in Kancheepuram drew 1 crore devotees in 48 days. The once-in 12-years Kumbakonam Mahamagam attracted 1.5 million people taking a holy dip. They are the biggest Hindu festivals in the state, but are hardly comparable to Thai Poosam in terms of size. ""It is comparable only with mega religious congregations such as Ardh Kumbh Mela which drew more than 24 crore pilgrims in 2019. But Kumbh Melas take place once in three to 12 years,"" said S Velusamy, president of Federation of Thai Poosam Peravai, TN.

But, unlike the Uttar Pradesh government which has put in place a permanent statutory authority headed by a senior IAS officer to oversee arrangements for the festival even during non-Kumbh years, successive governments in Tamil Nadu have not made much of an effort to ensure accessibility and safety of the thronging devotees during Thai Poosam. As of now, the festival is handled by local temple committees or by individual philanthropists.

The Uttar Pradesh government set up Prayagraj Mela Authority and spent more than `4,000 crore in 2019 to create infrastructure to handle the sea of devotees. For Thai Poosam, there is no central authority either to make a budgetary outlay or to create infrastructure for devotees, leaving people to fend for themselves or banking on the district authority.

As a first step, the government must acknowledge Thai Poosam as the biggest religious event in the state and declare a holiday to mark it. It is time the government created an authority to manage Thai Poosam, headed by a senior bureaucrat and assisted by other departments. The authority should have adequate financial sanction to create infrastructure at the six abodes of Lord Muruga and to other important temples where Thai Poosam is celebrated in a big way. It should be followed up with steps like organising transport, regulating crowd and institutionalising the way the festival is celebrated across the state and in the diaspora.

The initiative to streamline the festival celebration will be a statement of an administration’s understanding of its people.

KOLLAM: Eroor police have registered a case against a quack from Telangana who dispensed fake medicine and swindled money. Over 100 people, including children, developed serious illnesses at Eroor Pathadi near Anchal in the district after consuming medicine from the quack. The quack is absconding after the police registered a case.

Lakshman Raj, a native of Telengana, had allegedly distributed medicine to over 100 houses here for various ailments, assuring that the medicine could cure their diseases. But it was later found that the medicine contained a high amount of mercury, causing illness related to kidney and liver.

Muhammed Ali (4) son of Ubaid of Rahim Manzil, Pathadi, who took the medicine later developed fever and rashes all over his body . The boy who was admitted to a private hospital at Anchal was later shifted to the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.

His father said the boy had to be kept on the ventilator for 10 days . “The medicine given to the boy by the quack was examined at the govt’s chemical laboratory and it was found to contain mercury twenty times more than the permissible limit” he said.

When contacted Eroor police said that they had intensified the probe to arrest the quack. “We have registered a case against the quack after we received complaint from the parents of a four-year-old boy whose health worsened after consuming the medicine. Based on the complaint we are trying to trace the location of the culprit. So far 15 people have come forward to report the fraud,” a police official said.

Local people said the quack had collected Rs 500 to 20,000 from each patient.

SHADNAGAR: It was a regular Monday morning for people in Shadnagar in neighbouring Rangareddy district, but for Manne Vijay Kumar it was a terrifying start. He woke up to the news of a leopard resting on the terrace of his house on Patel Road. After a three-hour wait and 45-minute operation , the big cat was tranquillized and sent to Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad. In the melee, a constable suffered claw injuries.According to forest officials, the six-year-old male leopard, which was resting on the terrace beside a few flowerpots, was first sighted by Kumar’s children, who informed their parents about the animal and tried to approach it not knowing that it was a wild animal.The leopard is suspected to have strayed into the town from Kammadanam reserve forest, located about six kilometres away.“The children were lucky that their parents saw the leopard just in time and stopped them before they went close to the leopard. They took the children and rushed inside the house, locked the doors and dialled 100 for help,” Rangareddy district divisional forest officer Bheema Naik told TOI.Policemen, who reached the spot, confirmed the leopard’s presence after they spotted it from a neighbour’s terrace and informed the forest department. A team of forest officials and veterinary experts from Nehru Zoological Park reached the spot.“The leopard was resting at the same place till the rescue team from Hyderabad reached the spot. For about three hours, between 6am to 9am, it was just sitting there,” Naik said.At 9am, when the rescue team reached the spot and began the operation, the leopard went and hid behind the stairs.“It appears the leopard panicked because of the noise made by people gathered there. Police had to control the mob from coming close to the house before we could tranquillize it. The entire operation lasted about 45 minutes,” informed a zoo official.The leopard was tranquillized and shipped to Nehru Zoological Park, where it would be kept under observation for 48 hours before relocating it in the forest.When the tranquillizer was shot, the leopard leaped and ran for about 100 metres, injuring a police constable.

104,['21/01/2020'],"Denied VP post, NCP fighting to head 2 ZP panels","This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Haggling is going on between local Congress and NCP leaders for important posts in Nagpur Zilla Parishad ( ZP ). The post of both president and vice-president has gone to Congress while its pre-poll ally NCP was left high and dry.

There are seven subject committees in the ZP — public works, finance, education, water supply and sanitation, agriculture and animal husbandry, social welfare and women and child welfare. Of these, the first three are considered more important.

Home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP wants that the party should get two out of the three important committees — public works, finance and education. However, Congress is ready to concede only one.

During the previous BJP-Shiv Sena rule, the ZP president was head of the standing committee and one subject committee. The vice-president headed two subject committees. Congress wants to follow the same pattern, which leaves only four committees for others. This is the reason for the party’s reluctance to give more than one committee to the NCP.

Deshmukh’s problem is that Congress does not need NCP’s help in running the government in the ZP. Congress has 31 members in the house of 58 while NCP has 10.

The post of president was reserved for SC (woman). Deshmukh wanted the vice-president’s post, which was open, for his son Salil. However, dairy development minister Sunil Kedar of Congress refused to oblige.

Deshmukh was so upset that he publicly accused Congress of not honouring the alliance norms. He had told the media that NCP had given two proposals to Congress for consideration. As per one proposal, NCP wanted the post of vice-president and chairmanship of one of the subject committees. In another, NCP wanted chairmanship of two committees — one for a male and one for a woman member.

Senior NCP leader Praful Patel had come specially for the discussions and senior Congress leader Manikrao Thakre also was present apart from other leaders from both the parties. However, Congress rejected the first proposal.

Deshmukh had warned that if Congress did not take appropriate decision on the second proposal, repercussions would be felt across Maharashtra.

The relations had become so strained that district Congress president Rajendra Mulak had to publicly say that the Congress-NCP alliance was intact.

NEW DELHI: A fire at the Delhi Transport Corporation headquarters in north Delhi gutted the server room that controls the GPS and CCTV cameras of all buses, cabs and autorickshaws plying in the city. The fire spread to other rooms in the building and damaged important files pertaining to the RTO, employees claimed. Police are probing sabotage behind the fire.The fire department pressed 26 tenders into service to douse the flames. All employees were evacuated in time before the fire spread through the building.Fire officers said they received a call around 8.40am regarding the blaze on Rajpur Road in Civil Lines. Initially, eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot. It was found that the server room on the first floor was on fire. However, by the time the firemen could enter the building, the fire spread to the other rooms and the floor above. Subsequently, more fire tenders were called.“We had to break open the doors of a few rooms to gain access. The fire was brought under control shortly,” said a fire officer.In the fire, most of the systems connected to the server had damaged. However, senior transport officials said that the fire was not huge and affected only a portion of the first floor. “It will not affect the core and crucial work of the department,” claimed a senior official.The additional chief secretary has asked special commissioner (administration) to conduct an inquiry to find out the cause of the fire. A complete estimate of the loss of files and corrective steps for preventive action was also ordered by him.Fire officers said the blaze probably started from the diary and dispatch section of the transport department. “It appears that a short circuit caused the fire. However, the fire only affected routine sections of the department and no major branches,” said an officer.There were concerns about driving licences seized by the transport department having been burnt in the fire. However, a transport official clarified that the people didn’t have to worry as no records were destroyed and no public dealing branch was affected. “However, our state-of-the-art operation control and command centre, from where all public service vehicles are tracked through GPS, suffered damages,” the officer added.

108,['21/01/2020'],Amul fumes over CII’s demand to import SMP,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Co-operative versus Corporate

Vadodara: A co-operative versus private players battle seems to be brewing in India’s dairy sector. Home-grown dairy giant – Amul – has objected strongly to a proposal mooted by industry body –Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) - to import skimmed milk powder (SMP) at zero duty.

Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul has approached Union government asking it not to surrender to a ‘motivated representation’ of CII.

CII has approached ministry of food processing industries asking the government to allow import of 50,000 metric tonnes of SMP through National Dairy Development Board at zero duty for specific end-use in dairy industry and food processing industry on the grounds that it will help secure supplies and stabilize prices for dairy and food processing sector.

“This will overcome current challenges arising out of depletion of SMP stock in the country and shortfall in production,” CII’s proposal states.

Terming the proposal as ‘anti-farmer’, GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi has shot off a letter to secretary Pushpa Subrahmanyam stating that the fear of shortage of milk in the country is being created by private players and ice-cream manufacturers who want cheap raw material and is not in the interest of either farmers or consumers.

Amul has argued that overall milk production is growing at a healthy rate of 6 %. Last year, due to lower price of commodities, all the private players had stopped milk procurement which had resulted in unprecedented growth in milk procurement for all co-operatives, Amul has argued.

“If we compare last two years data, you will realize that milk procurement is growing at a healthy CAGR of 7-8% (which is much higher than global CAGR of less than 2%) and as a result of which, there is no shortage of milk anywhere in the country,” Sodhi’s letter to the Union secretary states.

Amul has argued that since last year when SMP price was Rs150 per kg, private players were using SMP instead of buying milk because of which all milk was getting diverted to co-operatives resulting in growth at over 20 %.

This year, it says, the situation has reversed with SMP price nearing Rs300 due to which private players have started using milk instead of SMP.

“This clearly proves the selfish motive of these private players at the cost of farmers as well as consumers. Last year, when they got cheap SMP, none of them passed on any price benefit to consumers by reducing prices of ice-cream or dairy products and left the milk producers at the mercy of co-operatives,” Amul has alleged, stressing that government should not bother about commodity price of milk powder as the total SMP domestic consumption is not even equal to 10 days of country’s total milk production.

110,['21/01/2020'],India had asked Pakistan to control locusts in December,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Jaipur: Though India had asked Pakistan to control hoppers (baby locusts withut wings) in December 2019, no steps were taken which ultimately turned into the voracious pink locusts, said Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director of Locust Control Organisation (LCO), Jodhpur, on Monday while visiting various locust-hit villages in Sriganganagar.

Officials said pink locusts are creating havoc in both the countries along the international border.

Gurjar told TOI over phone that a bilateral meeting took place between both the countries at Munabao in Barmer on December 4, 2019 in which he led the four-member delegation from the Indian side. “We had witnessed a large number of hoppers in the Pakistani side. In the meeting, Pakistani counterparts had crossed over and sat for the meeting at a place designated by the BSF at Munabao in Barmer. We had specifically told them to control the hoppers,” Gurjar said.

He added that these hoppers have now developed as pink locusts which are damaging crops in Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts. “Fresh movement of locusts was witnessed near Ramgarh area of Jaisalmer and in some parts of Raisinghnagar tehsil of Sriganganagar district,” he added.

Senior officials added that the movement of locusts was not only confined to India and its border districts especially Jaisalmer, Sriganganagar and Bikaner but were also seen flying in Pakistan territory.

On the ongoing presence of locusts in Rajasthan, Gurjar said, “Presently we are controlling them in Sriganganagar, Raisinghnagar, Ravla and Anoopgarh areas and our team is working at Ramgarh in Jaisalmer district.”

Senior LCO officials said they don’t believe to re-organise talks with Pakistan in this matter. “We are controlling locusts properly. There is no point in having more parleys in this regard as we don’t think they have enough wherewithals to control the menace,” said a senior officer.

Officials added that villages like Haroonabad, Dunga Banga and Gulab Ali of Bahawalpur district in Pakistan and some portions of Karachi are also affected with locusts as these are very close to Raisinghnagar of Sriganganagar district.

Representative image

ALLAHABAD: Special Task Force (STF) arrested a man for allegedly abducting a woman and brutally murdering her on Monday, four years after her half-burnt body was found on Kaushambi-Varanasi highway.

The accused Salman (26) was arrested in Daraganj along with an accomplice Lucky Panda alias Lucky (27), while planning to escape from the city. Police also seized two SUVs, a motorcycle, three mobile phones and Rs 2,450 cash from their possession.

During interrogation, Salman told the police that he and the deceased Rachna Shukla had become close friends in 2015 and he had also gifted her a scooty. “As the two-wheeler was registered under my name, she had been insisting to get it registered under her name,” the accused told the police.

The dispute escalated leading to a fight between the two. A few days later, her family lodged a case against Salman at Daraganj police station. Salman alleged that Rachna, who was 19 then, often used to insult him at public places, said police. Fed up of Rachna’s behaviour, Salman decided to kill her. He claimed that Salman and his aides slit Rachna’s throat, disposed her body on the highway and fled.

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “Rachna Shukla was allegedly abducted on April 16, 2016 from Daraganj. After she disappeared, her mother Uma Shukla had lodged a case under section 363 and 366 of the IPC against Salman and his accomplices.”

When police failed to get clues about the missing girl, the mother had also filed a petition in Allahabad high court . While working on the case, the STF team came to know that the accused had killed Rachna and thrown her body on the same day (April 16, 2016). They set the body afire at a location close to the Allahabad-Pratapgarh border.

On April 17, 2016, Pratapgarh police recovered a woman’s half-burnt body on the Kaushambi-Varanasi highway and registered a case under section 302 and 201 of IPC against unidentified persons.

On Monday, STF received a tip-off that the prime accused Salman and one of his accomplice were spotted near the Nagbasuki Temple Road. The team cordoned off the area and arrested Salman and Lucky from Daraganj.

113,['21/01/2020'],HCBA polls set to witness multi-cornered contests,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Multi-pronged contests are on cards to elect various office-bearers of the High Court Bar Association ( HCBA ), polls for which are likely to be held next month.

Many groups and individuals have already started campaigning even though the HCBA is yet to issue a formal notification in this regard.

According to lawyers, prominent groups like the one supported by Manohar family and others are in the process of finalizing candidates and are leaving no stone unturned to woo the voters. This time, the focus of all contesting groups is on youngsters.

So far, only an unnamed group supported by Shreerang Bhandarkar has finalized names of president and secretary’s posts. Sameer Sohoni has been finalized for the president’s post by this group, mostly comprising young lawyers. On other hand, there are talks of all powerful group, led by senior counsel Vyankatesh (VR) Manohar, supporting Deven Chauhan, but he’s yet to confirm his participation.

Names of Atul Pandey and Shridhar Purohit are also doing rounds for the president’s post. Seasoned candidate VG Bhamburkar, who unsuccessfully fought all elections for prestigious post for last many years, is likely to try his luck again, say sources.

The lawyers though predict that unlike 2017 polls, this year wouldn’t be as exciting as none of the big names are keen to contest. Last time, the HCBA had witnessed one of the most interesting battles between top lawyers for the president’s post, which was billed as “clash of titans”. Noted lawyers Anil Kilor (now HC judge) and Bhandarkar had fought an intense battle where the former narrowly defeated the latter by a margin of 60 votes. It was one of most closely watched battles in the association’s history. Kilor had polled 687 votes and Bhandarkar 627.

Bhandarkar told TOI that he would be making all efforts to ensure Sohoni and other team members from a group supported by him emerge winner.

Reminding about District Bar Association (DBA) polls, he said nobody gave even an outside chance to presidential candidate Kamal Satuja, who was pitted against popular lawyer Uday Dable, believed to be close to former CM, and had influence over lawyers practising in Nagpur district and sessions court. “But Satuja emerged winner. Therefore, nothing can be said in the polls even if opposite camp is strong,” he said.

Commenting on Bhandarkar’s claims, other lawyers stated that if Sohoni wins, it would be for the first time since 1990s that candidates from powerful group backed by Manohar family wouldn’t be at the helm of affairs in the HCBA. Last time, it happened in 1993 when senior counsel Shrihari Aney won the polls, they informed.

AURANGABAD: Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsath, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal and three others have booked by police on the charges of voluntarily causing hurt, criminal intimidation, unlawful assembly and rioting.

“Sena office-bearer, former corporator and contractor Sushil Khedkar was allegedly assaulted by the MLA and others at the MLA’s over the issue of tender for a road project on Saturday,” Vedantnagar police said while citing Khedkar’s complaint lodged on Sunday night.

When contacted by TOI, Shirsath refuted the allegations as baseless. “Khedkar came to my office in an inebriated condition and created a scene over awarding of the road contract to another party,” said the MLA from Aurangabad (west) assembly constituency.

As per the police station record, offences have been registered against the five under IPC sections 324, 323, 504, 506, 143, 147, 148, 149. Police source said that the sections are bailable in nature and that no one has been arrested yet.

Senior police inspector Rameshwar Rodge told TOI that technical evidence, like CCTV footage from in and around the spot of the alleged assault, is being collected to verify things before further action is taken.

According to the complaint, Khedkar, along with his friends Anup Mundada and Bhimrao Hegde, reached the MLA’s office on Saturday afternoon. The MLA allegedly told him to withdraw from the tendering of the said road work.

Khedkar has alleged that when he refused to withdraw the tender, the MLA allegedly slapped him. “Deputy mayor Janjal along with Raju Rajput, Anil Birare and Nilesh Narwade then assaulted him and his two friends,” he has alleged.

The MLA, however, said, “I had promised the people in Satara Deolai that I would get a road constructed soon after the elections and got special funds of Rs 10 crore from the CM. After the tenders were issued, bids were accepted and even work orders were released. Khedkar objected to it, resulting into delay of work by four months and re-tendering.”

Citing some of the previous works carried by Khedkar through his kin, the MLA said the complainant has a poor track record as far as quality and punctuality of work is concerned. “Unhappy over not getting the work order, he started creating hurdles in the work bagged by another contractor and created a ruckus at my office.”

Deputy mayor Janjal said, “The contractor has been misusing the Shiv Sena tag and pressuring different officials for getting his works done. He was drunk when he came to the MLA’s office and started abusing everyone. In fact, i tried to pacify him, but he has framed me in the case.”

Janjal said that Sena district president and MLC Ambadas Danve was also present at the spot when Khedkar created a scene.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After holding a week-long road safety awareness drive across the city, the motor vehicles department along with the squads of regional transport office (enforcement), Thiruvananthapuram , will begin checking at various locations in the city from next week to nab defaulters.

A drive to create awareness about MV Act Amendment and safety violations was conducted by the squad in association with NCC cadets at Manaveeyam road and Kowdiar last week, as part of road safety observance.

“The awareness drive was held to educate motorists. Since, most of the squads were sent on Sabarimala duty, the checking was conducted by two squads. After other squads return to the city, they will begin checking,” said Bijumon K, RTO, enforcement.

There are seven enforcement squads under Thiruvananthapuram RTO Enforcement that functions round-the-clock under different shifts. In the combined checking drive, the squads will be assigned specific locations in the city limits to conduct inspection simultaneously. In the previous combined drive held at seven routes in the city, the squads collected a penalty of Rs 2,13,500 from 214 check reports for various road safety violations.

Speaking about the need for strict checking, Bijumon added that motorists are reluctant to wear helmets. “Combined inspection at different locations will help spot defaulters more easily.”

“The helmet rule is not strictly followed by motorists. When compared to people in rural Kerala , city dwellers are more prone to checking and hence most of them obey rules. Irrespective of where they stay, people should understand the need for following rules,” he added.

Vadodara: Non-vegetarians are delighted in winter as this season is considered best time to gorge on eggs and chicken. But poultry farms seem to have badly hit for an unusual reason- bitter cold - at a time when they were looking at brisk business.

Thousands of hens and chicks in poultry farms in Chhota Udepur and parts of Vadodara district had died due to cold in the last fortnight.

The average temperature in the region may have hovered around 12 degrees but in some parts, due to open farms, the mercury may have plummeted further, resulting in high mortality among the fowls.

At a poultry farm near Bhatpur village in Sankheda, around 1,100 hens and chicks died over the weekend. “The temperature has fallen due to which these sudden deaths have taken place. Every year few fowl die, but this year the number is unusually high, that too in a short span,” said the owner of the poultry farm Deep Patel. On Monday morning too, 26 deaths were reported at Patel’s farm.

In Vadodara’s Padra taluka, around 4,000 hens have died in a single poultry farm this season. Saddam Abbas Chauhan, who owns six farms, said that the caretaker of the particular farm did not take proper precaution. “I have let out the farm to a caretaker who did not take precautionary measures at all,” said Chauhan. He added that there has been no mortality at his other farms this year, but in the past fowls have died. “The figure has never been this huge,” he said.

In two other poultry farms near Malu and Bhatpur villages in Sankheda, 149 hens died over the weekend. The owners of these farms refused to coment, but cold is being blamed as the reason behind it.

Chauhan, who is in this business for around eight years, said that if it is a small poultry farm, the owner is going to face loss. “But if the farm is huge or the owner has several other farms then the loss can be covered,” Chauhan said. He further added that although deaths have been reported at many farms it is unlikely that meat prices are going to increase.

“I have heard about mortality at many poultry farms. But there are many players who will fill the supply gap,” he told TOI.

Deaths due to cold a common phenomenon

Deaths of hens and chicks due to low temperature is a common phenomenon, but this can be avoided if poultry farm owners take precautions. “Normal body temperatures of birds range from 104 oF to 109 oF. Their bodies cannot low temperature during winters as they feel stressed,” said Dr Divyesh Kelawala from Anand Agricultural University. “Poultry farm owners have to take utmost care so that the cold winds do not enter the cage,” he added. Kelawala, however, found the death figures humongous. He said that thousands of birds dying in certain number of farms is surprising. “It could be because the owner did not take proper care or because of some outbreak,” he said.

JAIPUR: To ensure quality and provide safe-to-eat goat meat for consumers, the Rajasthan government has decided to tag goats meant for consumption with QR codes. This will help buyers to check the last date of vaccination, diseases of goats and medicines given for it. All information will be available online and customers can also order tagged goats online.The state has the largest population of goats in the country, with the Livestock Census 2019 recording over 20 million goats. The government has started a pilot project for the same in Pisangan gram panchayat in Ajmer.This initiative has been undertaken by the Rajasthan Agriculture Competitiveness Project (RACP) along with the Rajasthan Animal Husbandry Department. RACP has created the Pisangan Mahila Bakri Palak Producer Company Ltd (PMBPPCL) in Pisangan with a group of women shareholders who will run the project.At present, 350 women are shareholders in the company in Pisangan which has set a target of tagging 10,000 animals in the first phase.State agriculture commissioner and director of RACP Om Prakash said, “We have tagged more than 300 goats for the project and have set a target to cover 10,000 animals in the coming days.”“The lady link workers (LLW) will go door-to-door with a veterinarian to tag the goats and maintain their digital records. We are trying to make goat meat in the state safe as done in foreign countries,” Prakash said.In December 2019, the government launched the website www.rajasthangoat.com for consumers to order tagged goats online.Pritpal Singh Kalra, project coordinator of RACP, said that this project would give a good online marketing platform for goat farms. “Goats should be vaccinated 15 days before being taken to slaughter house. This project will ensure that and help goat farmers sell them online. We have launched a mobile app called ‘Rajasthan Goat’ though which customers can track their goats,” said Kalra.Currently, only the Sirohi breed of goats are tagged and sold under the project. Later, after the project is implemented in the entire state, other breeds will also be included. While the project is only meant for meat production now, it will later include milk as well.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73464744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-648388,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-goats-to-betagged-with-qr-code-for-quality/articleshow/73453448.cms

The model of the Bal Mandir

Allahabad: Ramjanmabhoomi Ramalaya Nyas secretary Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati has said that “the construction of temple at Ayodhya could begin only after the government hands over land to the nyas (trust), which represents four Shankaracharyas, five Vaishnavacharyas and 13 akhadas.”

“Ramalaya Nyas is the apex body of dharmacharyas of Sanatan Hindu dharma (religion) and has informed the government of its commitment to build the temple. The work would begin once the land is handed over to the nyas. If it is overlooked, the move would be opposed and dissatisfied people could even approach courts,” Saraswati said here on Monday.

He said Jyotishpeethadishwar Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswatiji Maharaj had started the symbolic construction of a Ram temple by offering prayers to Sun God on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.

“According to shastras, a new temple cannot be constructed at a site which has once been demolished. Hence, we would a construct a ‘Bal Mandir’ of sandalwood first before starting with the actual. The temple’s dimensions would be 24x24x36 foot. The singhasan (throne) on which Ram Lalla would sit on would be made of gold and would be around 6x6x9 foot. It would be put in the middle of the Bal Mandir,” Saraswati added. The proposed model of the Bal Mandir would be put on display at the camp of the Shankaracharya at Magh mela from Tuesday onwards.

Kozhikode: The Supreme Court , on Monday, granted Kerala government four weeks ’ time to file an additional affidavit in the NH-766 night traffic ban case.

The court granted the request of the counsel of the Kerala government who pointed out that a request had been filed seeking time to file an additional affidavit on the court’s earlier suggestion in August 2018 on upgrading the alternative roads (Kutta-Gonikkupa route) so that the forest stretch of the NH-766 cutting through Bandipur Tiger Reserve can be closed down.

Meanwhile, Nilgiris-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee, which has been spearheading the campaign to revoke the decade-old night traffic ban, said that it was unfortunate that the state government could not submit a proper affidavit before the apex court on such an important issue even after five months.

The affidavit submitted by the Kerala government in the Supreme Court in December had sparked off a controversy as the affidavit was submitted a day before the ministerial-level meeting was a held in Thiruvananthapuram to finalize the points to be included in the affidavit.

Also, action committee leaders had pointed out that many points in the affidavit were not factual and could help the proposal for making the alternative road permanent. Following the row, the transport department authorities had said that they would file an additional affidavit.

It was the Karnataka high court which had imposed the night traffic ban on the forest stretch of NH- 766 linking Kerala and Karnataka in 2009 to prevent road-kills of wildlife and the Supreme Court made the suggestion on having an alternative road while considering Kerala government’s petition challenging the Karnataka high court order.

AURANGABAD: City police have booked a youth for allegedly demanding extortion of Rs 1 lakh from a city-based industrialist by threatening to make the personal photographs of the latter’s wife go viral on the internet.

Investigation officer and assistant sub-inspector Kalyan Shelke said, “We have registered a case against the suspect for trying to extort money from the woman teacher’s husband.”

Shelke said the process of identifying the suspect and as to how he got the contact number of the industrialist and his friend is also being probed.

As per complaint lodged by 52-year-old proprietor of a private limited firm, he received a call on Thursday afternoon from an unidentified number when he along with his wife and friend were sitting in their house, located on Beed Bypass road.

The suspect, while introducing him by his first name, told the industrialist that his wife has taken Rs 1 lakh from him and has stopped answering his phone calls. He even threatened that if his money is not paid, he will make the woman’s pictures go viral.

When the complainant inquired about it with his wife the latter claimed she had no idea about the suspect or the money. Later, the suspect called on the mobile phone of the industrialist’s friend who too was sitting in the house and reiterated his demand for money.

Initially the family, fearing social stigma, did not lodge a complaint. But on Sunday, they reached out to the Osmanpura police station and lodged a complaint against the suspect.

NEW DELHI: Alongside a 16-year-old braveheart who gave his life saving three friends , 21 other children were recognised for their acts of uncommon bravery by the Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW). Their names were announced on Tuesday at a media interaction with the children and their parents.However, there was no clarity on Tuesday about when the bravery awards would be given to the children and by whom. Last year, ICCW had found itself in an unnecessary controversy after the central government disassociated itself from these national awards. It is also unclear whether the 22 children will participate in the Republic Day parade as customary.While Muhammad Muhsin of Kozhikode, Kerala, lost his life saving three flailing friends in a turbulent sea, there were others who risked life and limb to save people. When TOI spoke to the parents of the 10 girls among the awardees, they were overcome by emotion at what their daughters had accomplished.Among the girls is Alaika, a 13-year-old from Himachal Pradesh. She saved her parents and grandfather as the car they were in hung in the air after falling down a cliff. Her mother, Savita Upadhyay, narrated, “We were driving to her cousin’s birthday. At Palampur our car went off the road, but luckily the car was stopped in its descent by a tree trunk. Alaika was the first to gain consciousness among us and she fearlessly scrambled up the cliff in the dark and got help. Had it not been for her, we wouldn’t have survived.” Long taunted in the village for not having a son, the family is now regarded with respect, she added.Adithya K’s moment also came during a car accident. On May 1 last year, the 15-year-old was returning from Nepal with 42 other tourists from Kerala when around 50km from the Indian border at Dunnein, the bus caught fire. The driver fled, leaving the passengers, among them five children and some senior citizens, stranded behind jammed doors. Adithya shattered the rear windshield with a hammer and kicked the glass out, ignoring the splinters that pierced his feet and arms. The passengers scrambled to safety, just in time to escape the diesel tank explosion.Sartaj Mohidin Mugal and Mudasir Ashraf from Jammu and Kashmir will be also honoured. Mugal was at home on October 24 when Pakistan violated the ceasefire and rained gunfire on Chowkibal and Tumina in Kashmir’s Kupwara district. A resident of Tumina village, he was on the first floor when a shell hit his house. He jumped out but realised that his two sisters and parents were still inside the house. He rushed back and brought his sisters out to safety. He then ran into the house and dragged his unconscious parents out before the house collapsed.Ashraf, 18, was one of the many villagers who rushed to the site of a MI-17 helicopter crash in his village of Grind Kalan in Budgam on February 27 last year. The teenager saw a man still alive in the burning chopper and risked his life trying to pull him out. Unfortunately, the man, engulfed in flames, could not be saved before help arrived. Later, when the rescue teams consisting of personnel of security forces and the National Disaster Relief Force reached the crash site, Ashraf assisted them in retrieving the mortal remains of the helicopter crew.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73514251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-266434,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/brave-acts-18-year-old-who-saved-parents-from-pak-shelling-a-cliffhanger-and-more/articleshow/73501773.cms

Yet another speaker Bheem Dutt Joshi spoke about steps being taken by ZSI for conservation of wildlife. “The aim of the project funded by National Mission of Himalayan Studies (NHMS) is to generate information on threatened Himalayan fauna, develop protocol for conservation of these species and to enhance capacity of forest department, NGOs, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and local villagers. At present we are focusing on snow leopard, brown bear, Tibetan wolf, Himalayan thar, monal and some other prime species of Uttarkashi. We will plan our conservation activities and research on basis of these selected species.”

AURANGABAD: The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) continued in different parts of the region on Monday.

Activists of the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) took out a rally in Beed on Monday, while activists in Latur have planned a three-day stir in the city from January 22. Meanwhile, the sit-in agitations outside the district collector’s office in Aurangabad and Nanded continued.

After the rally, VBA activists in Beed handed over a memorandum to the district collector that sought the scrapping of the controversial laws. The agitators described these processes to be anti-people and against the constitution. VBA spokesperson Babanrao Wadmare said the President must intervene and reject these laws.

‘Amhi Laturkar, CAA, NRC Virodhi Jan Andolan’, an organization formed in Latur, has decided to stage agitations for three days at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Park to register their protest against the laws. Lawyer Uday Gaware said these laws were inter-connected and intended for all communities.

“These are not limited to Muslims, but the government intends to hit Hindus too, particularly adivasi, OBC, Buddhists, and other communities. It’s also intended to create differences among different communities and religions. In such a situation, people must join hands and resist the government’s divisive move,” he said.

He said intellectuals and social activists from across the country are expected to come to Latur to express their solidarity with the agitators. They are expecting visit by Justice B G Kolse Patil (retd), Swami Agnivesh, Waman Meshram, Kannan Gopinathan and noted poet Imran Pratapgadi , said Gaware.

Villupuram: Four people died and 20 others were injured when a speeding private bus crashed into a stationary government bus and ploughed into a group of people standing on the roadside at Eranji in Kallakurichi district in the early hours of Monday.

136,['21/01/2020'],"82 per cent of students cleared hostel dues, claims JNU VC M Jagadesh Kumar","This story is from January 21, 2020

M Jagadesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar in a statement on Monday claimed that out of the 8,500 students at the varsity, 82% of them had cleared their hostel dues for the winter registration. He added that the remaining students were also expected to complete their registration process, and the campus was peaceful despite the strike call given by the students’ union.

The VC announced that for their Republic Day parade, NCC cadets of the varsity will be participating. “The university is putting every effort to help the willing students in getting registered for the winter semester . The campus is peaceful and active in pursuing academic activities,” he stated.

The VC’s claims were contradicted by JNUSU, which said that the strike and boycott of academic activities were still going on in the campus. “How can classes happen when the backlog of monsoon semester is not yet cleared?” asked Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president.

Since the inter-hall administration (IHA) meeting on October 28, which hiked the hostel fee, protests have continued on the varsity premises. Recently, there was a call to boycott registrations for the winter semester. But as per claims of the VC, 82% of the students have cleared their hostel dues for the winter registration.

“Only clearing hostel dues, however, doesn’t mean that students have registered. You have to pay advance hostel and mess charges and also the registration charges. That is yet to happen for a majority of students,” said Farhat Salim, councillor of the centre for the study of law and governance.

Moon claimed that the students are still with JNUSU and waiting for the legal action. “The union will file a case on January 21 against the IHA meeting, terming it a violation of the JNU constitution.”

The VC said in his statement that the university was also gearing up to celebrate the Republic Day.

“This year, for the first time, the NCC cadets of the university will be participating in a parade at the venue of flag hoisting during the Republic Day celebrations,” Kumar added.

137,['21/01/2020'],Slum dwellers relocated from airport land to make way for longer taxiway,"This story is from January 21, 2020

The BMC has moved the families to Panda Kudia, a locality where they will get a piece of land under Rajiv Awas... Read More

BHUBANESWAR: Work on the expansion of the parallel taxiway at Biju Patnaik International Airport is likely to start soon, as the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has addressed the biggest hurdle facing the upgrade — encroachment of land.

The BMC on Monday relocated 110 families from the Farm Gate slum, which had come up on the land needed for the expansion of the parallel taxiway. The BMC has moved the families to Panda Kudia, a locality where they will get a piece of land under Rajiv Awas Yojana.

“The relocation began in the morning. The Panda Kudia locality has been identified for the slum residents’ relocation. There were a few encroachers on that land as well, but we have freed the area of them,” said a BMC officer.

The airport had sought land for the expansion of the taxiway in 2015. The BMC officials said they had received Rs 2 crore from the Airports Authority of India to rehabilitate the residents of the slum. The relocation took four years, even though the residents had given their consent to the process.

The airport requires close to an acre of land to expand the parallel taxiway. Currently, it has a short taxiway, which is used by aircraft to access the runway. The disadvantage of the short taxiway is that aircraft have to make a U-turn to take off after getting on to the runway. A parallel taxiway — which is the path between the runway and the apron — will allow the aircraft to run parallel with the runway and get on to it only when it is ready to take off. The present taxiway category of the airport is 4C; after the expansion it will be 4D.

The parallel taxiway will thus reduce the waiting time for departing flights as they will no longer need to make turns on the runway. “The Air Traffic Control can declare the runway space free more quickly after the parallel taxiway becomes operational,” an airport official said.

The city airport records around 63,000 aircraft movements a year.

The two-page pamphlet

Allahabad: The protests erupting across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) aside, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) has roped in over 30,000 volunteers to distribute pamphlets containing detailed about the law to muster support.

The volunteers are associated with various organisations associated closely with RSS, namely Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), BJP’s Yuva Morcha (BJPYM), LokJagran Manch (LJM), Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarathi Parishad (ABVP), Bajrang Dal and Durga Vahini.

“RSS has divided the entire district into two parts, Prayag Uttar (city north) and Prayag Dakshin (city south). Then there are 29 nagar (wards) spanning across different localities,” said RSS prantiya prachaar pramukh, Murarji Tripathi.

The two-page pamphlet features photographs of minor Hindu girls who were abducted or sexually abused and were forced to convert to Islam in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Besides, the pamphlet also mentions several facts about the new citizenship law under a column called ‘myth’.

The document also features a picture of Mahatma Gandhi and one of his quotes which reads: “Pakistan me rehne wale Hindu aur Sikh har nazariya se Bharat aa sakte hai, agar wo wahan nahi rehna chahte hain. Tab unhe naukri dena, unke jeevan ko samanya banana Bharta sarkar ka pehla kartavya hai. (Hindus and Sikh living in Pakistan can always come to India, if they do not want to live there. In such a situation, it is the government’s responsibility to provide them with jobs and ensure that there is normalcy in their lives.)”

The coloured pamphlet explains why the government introduced CAA in the country.

Tirupati: An air of mystery shrouds the death of a 19-year-old housewife, reported at Dandi Kuppam village in Santhipuram mandal of Chittoor district.

According to Rallabaduguru police, the parents and relatives of the victim—Soundarya—lodged a complaint against her husband and family members, stating they were involved in her death, which they suspected as unnatural.

Soundarya, who hails from Bangarupet in Karnataka, got married to Vinod Kumar of Dandi Kuppam village about two years ago. Soundarya’s parents said that they gave Vinod Kumar dowry along with several precious gifts at the time of the marriage.

In their complaint, Soundarya’s parents alleged that the couple had been leading a disturbed life on account of multiple altercations between them in the last six months.

On Sunday night, after Soundarya was found lying unconscious at her home at Dandi Kuppam village, her husband and in-laws rushed her to PES hospital at Kuppam, where she died while undergoing treatment.

Suspecting her daughter’s death was not natural, the victim’s mother along with other family members lodged a complaint at the Rallabuduguru police station on Monday.

Sub inspector Murali Mohan said a case was registered and further investigation was going on. He clarified that the cause of death remained unclear and police were awaiting the autopsy report to proceed.

CUTTACK: Ravenshaw University has finally started recruitment of teachers and has invited applications for 180 posts of professors, associate professors and assistant professors. This is significant as the university has been facing acute faculty crunch and working with only around 100 teachers for over six years.

The university started accepting online applications from January 10. The last date to send in applications is February 10.

Vice-chancellor Ishan Patro told TOI on Monday that the university hoped to complete the process in three to five months. “The recruitment process will be time-consuming. Applications have been invited for 180 posts in 19 departments,” he said. “Scrutiny of applications and scheduling of dates for interviews will depend on the number of applications received,” the vice-chancellor added.

University officials said more than 2,500 applications were expected for 24 professors’ posts, 44 associate professors’ posts and 115 assistant professors’ posts.

Since 2014, Ravenshaw initiated the recruitment process twice but failed to make any appointment as the high court had quashed both advertisements on grounds that they violated University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines.

The Ravenshaw Bikash Abhijan (RBA), which constitutes city-based alumna and social activists, hoped that the university would complete the recruitment process this time. “We are happy that Ravenshaw has finally started the process for recruitment of teachers. We expect the authorities to ensure that the advertisement is litigation-proof,” RBA president Chittaranjan Mohanty said.

Now, we have received administrative approval for two important simulators,” Dr Mitra said. The lab will be established at the top floor of medical stores building.

Skills lab will have mannequins for basic operations such as CPR, intramuscular injection, catheterization, suture procedure etc. In advanced category, doctors may try their hands in joint replacements such as shoulder, hip, knee joint and other operations. Dr Mitra said lab would be linked with international certification agencies in future.

“Skills lab will fulfil all global standards. So, we will link it with many national and international certificate courses. Students will get their skills tested on simulators and get certificates from global agencies right here,” Dr Mitra added.

Najeeb Jung

NEW DELHI: Ex-lieutenant governor of Delhi and former vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, Najeeb Jung , on Monday expressed solidarity with the varsity students, who have been protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the alleged police action in the campus on December 15.

Addressing the students near the varsity campus, Jung said that the agitation will continue till demands of equality before law are met. The new citizenship act needs a revamp and should include Muslims as well, he added. He requested the Prime Minister and the home minister to hold a press conference and clear the air on NRC.

“The PM has said that NRC will not happen but why do people not believe it? This is a matter of shame that lakhs don’t believe in the PM as there are detention centres being built in Assam and other places. I suggest the PM and the home minister to hold a press conference and state that there won’t be any NRC.”

Jung further told the students: “Nobody can ask you if you are an Indian or not. The agitation won’t end till amendment is made to the CAA. And amendment is not difficult as they just have to include the religion that has been excluded.”

“Granting citizenship on the basis of religion violates Article 14 of the Constitution.”

The former LG added that at the time of Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption andolan, Arvind Kejriwal and others were called by the government to discuss the issues. “Today when the entire country is revolting why the government doesn’t want to meet them? The government should clarify and satisfy the students as today’s youth will run the country in future,” he said.

Calling NRC as the ‘dada’ of CAA, he said that the movement against CAA should remain secular. “This is not just a Muslim protest, but an Indian protest.”

Despite efforts to divide the country, the Act has united people for communal harmony, he added.

He asked students to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Mohamamd Ali Johar. “This agitation should be led by students and has no place for clerics and their ideas.""

Safety is major concern now for buildings constructed 30 years ago

Vadodara: Concerned over stability of its houses constructed three decades ago, Gujarat Housing Board (GHB) has approached Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) asking it to issue notices to occupants and get the houses vacated.

The GHB has a series of schemes across the city, particularly in western parts like Gorwa and Subhanpura. Many of these houses were constructed 30 years ago and have become a reason for concern for the housing board now.

The GHB has written to the VMC stating that the board has no authority to get these houses vacated. It has stated that notices had been issued to the blocks earlier and a public notice too was issued in this regard. Despite this, the residents have not vacated the houses.

Sources said the offers of redevelopment of such colonies by the housing board have also met with lukewarm response. Fearing for the safety of the houses as well as those staying there, the GHB has started the process of conducting a structural audit of the buildings. Parallel to the process, the board wrote a letter to the VMC asking it to issue notices to the residents and get the houses vacated. The board has contended that it has no authority to get the houses vacated.

VMC sources said the issue was discussed in detail and the civic body had decided to ask the board for structural report of the houses. The VMC will take further action based on the structural report. An official said issuing notices in bulk would lead to a lot of panic.

“There are hundreds of such houses and any action without strong grounds can lead to panic. Once the report is finalized, we can take action based on it,” said the official. He said the VMC would reply to the GHB accordingly.

The electorate are members of local self government bodies.

The remaining candidates, Shankar Bade, Sanjay Derkar, Shrikant Munginwar and Deepak Neelawar, are all contesting as independents. The polling will be held on January 31.

Munginwar and Bade are Congress rebels. BJP took Bajoria, an NCP activist, in its fold at the last minute and granted ticket to him though many BJP loyalists had sought candidature.

Both Dushiyant and Sumit are financially sound and their supporters have already started contacting the 490 voters who are members of zilla parishad, municipal councils and nagar panchayats.

It is learnt, prominent candidates are trying to move voters to an unknown destination to secure their votes. But voters are not swearing allegiance to any particular camp as the voting date is still 10 days away.

In 2016, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance candidate Tanaji Sawant had won the poll though Congress had the upper edge. Both Dushyant and Sumit consider it as a prestigious election for their political career.

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The anti-corruption bureau ( ACB ) caught a revenue official red-handed while she was demanding and accepting bribe at the district collectorate in Machilipatnam in Krishna district on Monday.

The accused, identified as Prashanthi, is an officer in the land reforms section. According to ACB officials, they received a complaint from Meka Ramalingeswara Reddy of Undavalli village in Guntur district.

In his complaint, he stated that he had purchased around 4.53 acres of land in Katuru village in Krishna district in 2015 in his mother’s and sister’s names. They had then applied for pattadar passbooks at the tahsildar’s office at Vuyyur town through Mee Seva. The tahsildar told them that as the land is under Land Ceiling Act the file will be processed in the land reforms’ section at the district collectorate in Machilipatnam. On January 10, the tahsildar of Vuyyur sent notices to him and his mother and sister to meet the section officer in land reforms to get the pattadar passbooks and title deeds for their land.

When they met Prasanthi on January 12, she demanded Rs 6 lakh to issue the pattadar passbooks. Later, on January 19, she demanded that they part her Rs 3 lakh first. Following this, Ramalingeswara Reddy lodged a complaint with the ACB who laid a trap on Monday afternoon.

Jawaharlal Nehru University

NEW DELHI: A Right to Information query filed by an activist has put a question mark on the claims made by the JNU administration regarding the damage to the server room on January 3 and 4.

The reply to the RTI filed under the “life and liberty” clause by activist Saurav Das mentioned that 17 optical fibres were damaged on January 4 at 1pm, but, contrary to the JNU administration’s claims, it stated that the server room was shut on January 3.

“There is no mention of any damage on January 3, the day on which the administration claims that masked vandals entered and destroyed the servers, thereby stopping the registration process,” Das said. The RTI mentions that “register entries could not be done due to the crisis situation for resuming ICT services” and “the premises was under full control of security branch”.

The RTI also revealed that the university didn’t have any continuous footage of the four CCTV cameras at the north gate of the varsity on January 5, the day outsiders entered the campus and unleashed violence on students.

On the query put up by Das as to why there was no recording of the day the violence took place, the administration clarified that CCTV cameras were Wi-Fi enabled and, hence, no recording was done. The administration also informed that no footage of the CCTV cameras were uploaded to the cloud computing platform.

The FIR registered by Delhi Police on the complaint of the JNU administration had said that the servers were damaged, hence there was no CCTV footage.

Despite several attempts made by TOI, the JNU administration did not respond to queries.

Solar panels on the roof of Vijayawada station

VIJAYAWADA: Vijayawada railway station has become the first in the country to set up a solar photovoltaic cover over platform (COP) at platform numbers 4 and 5 in the station.

A press release said the plan to utilise the platform roof to harness solar energy is the first-of-its-kind in the history of Indian Railways. The capacity of the solar plant installed at Vijayawada station is 65 kilowattpeak (kWp), the highest installed on any cover over platform in a railway station.

The station is also the first to have an installed capacity of over 50 kWp solar panels on a cover over platform.

The solar roof has been installed at a cost of Rs 60 lakhs. Given the hot and humid climate of Vijayawada, railway officials are exploring means to harness solar power to cater to the electricity consumption needs of the station. The cover over platform on platform numbers 4 and 5 has been made up of solar panels without using any galvanized sheets.

To install the solar plant, 198 solar panels, each with a capacity of 330 Wp were erected directly onto the shelter, covering a length of 33 meters. Power generated from the structure can cover 17 per cent of the power needs of the station, resulting in a savings of Rs 8.1 lakhs per annum.

Apart from power generation, the solar panels provide shelter to passengers. Plans are underway to set up a similar solar COP.

Gajanan Mallya, general manager of South Central Railway (SCR) zone appreciated the efforts of Vijayawada division officials. He advised officials to set up more such plants. “These solar plants will help in reducing the expenditure of the zone towards power needs and also helps in promoting a green environment,” he said.

Vadodara: Environment activists have opposed Gujarat government’s decision to prepare a detail project report (DPR) for Vishwamitri river.

City-based Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti (PSS) on Monday issued notices to Gujarat chief minister (CM), chief secretary, heads of state and central pollution control boards apart from heads of municipal corporation and district administration to first implement the earlier orders of Supreme Court, the National Green Tribunal and other bodies before preparing DPR for the river that passes through the heart of the city.

“Gujarat CM organised an urgent meeting on December 20 and made an announcement about DPR for the river. We are utterly shocked as it did not put any direction for resolving the pending issues regarding the river and neither it addressed failure of Vadodara Municipal Corporation in implementing repeated directions given by the concerned authorities,” environment activist Rohit Prajapati said.

The activists have demanded that there should be investigation on why earlier directives from various bodies were not followed and all officials responsible for the inaction should be prosecuted.

Also, they have demanded that construction and demolition waste management rules should be implemented, technically correct contour survey, digital elevation models should be prepared with the advise from experts.

PSS has demanded that there should be a semi-statutory body comprising of subject experts as well as experienced members of the community at large to guide and monitor the remediation of the damage done and any new development initiatives that the government would undertake to improve local ecosystems.

Also, disaster mitigation plans for the city by using landscape and ecosystem approaches right from the origin of Vishwamitri river and all the villages and towns in the watershed of this river should be prepared.

BHUBANESWAR: Odisha will host a mock drill of BIMSTEC countries — Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan — on tackling disasters such as floods and cyclones from February 11 to 14.

Disclosing this here on Monday, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) director general Satya Narayan Pradhan said, “The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) chose Odisha for the mock drill because of its experience and excellence. This apart, the heritage sites of Puri and Konark along the coastline make it a perfect choice.” The mock drill would be part of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation Disaster Management Exercise.

Odisha had won global acclaim for tackling of Cyclone Fani that struck the Odisha coast near Puri on May 3 last year, causing large-scale damage to infrastructure. It was the rarest of rare summer cyclones — the first one in 43 years to hit Odisha and one of the three to hit the state in last 150 years with a wind velocity of over 200 km/hour. Because of massive mobilisation of manpower, the government managed to keep the death toll at a low of 64.

Pradhan said the BIMSTEC event will be inaugurated in Bhubaneswar. After a theoretical session and indoors discussions on the first day, the professionals will shift to the artificial village near Ramachandi for the practice session, the NDRF DG said.

The NDRF DG said around 16 to 20 representatives from the participating countries will take part in the mock exercise. “An artificial village will be created near Ramachandi (on Puri-Konark Marine Drive). Simulation of the artificial village and a big temple being flooded will be done to learn the practise the rescue exercise,” he said.

While NDRF will be the nodal agency to execute the mock drill, other agencies (fire, state disaster response forces) involved in similar operations would also participate. All the participating nations have similar experience of floods and cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, he said.

Pradhan, who paid a courtesy call to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, said during a meeting with Naveen, the state government proposed to have NDRF points — stationing of manpower and facilities — at Nabarangpur and Burla ( Sambalpur ). A decision on this may be taken in a few weeks, he said.

Slug: PM Awaas Yojana

Bijnor: After complaints against officials for allegedly seeking a bribe for allotting houses under PM Awaas Yojana (urban) in Bijnor, District Urban Development Agency (DUDA) directed the private company assigned the task of identifying the beneficiaries to sack a junior engineer and surveyor and transfer three other employees.

On Monday, the company dismissed junior engineer Ravi Kashyap and surveyor Deep Singh, who were posted in Haldaur civic body. Another junior engineer, Ravindra Kumar, and surveyors Parveen Kumar and Sachin Kumar, were shunted to another area. They were posted in Jhalu Nagar panchayat

The action was taken after applicants for the scheme in their complaint alleged that these employees were asking for Rs 20,000 as bribe from each beneficiary for allotting houses to them.

The PM Awaas Yojana, urban, launched by the ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation envisages housing for all by 2022. Under the scheme, people who do not have their own houses or live in ‘kuchha’ houses are eligible. They are provided around Rs 2.50 lakh in three installments for buying the houses built under the yojana. In Bijnor district, some 30,000 people have applied for 15,742 units to be built in the current financial year.

According to sources, DUDA had hired some surveyors and junior engineers from a private company to survey and verify the applicants. However, the two junior engineers and three surveyors who were assigned the task were found allegedly extorting money from would-be beneficiaries by promising them a house under the scheme.

Narendra Mishra, project officer of DUDA, said, “Applicants under the scheme complained that some junior engineers and surveyors were forcing them to give money for providing a house to each of them. After receiving the complaints, we probed the matter and asked the company to sack or transfer the erring employees.”

Some months ago, the issue was raised at a meeting headed by in charge minister and he had ordered re-verification of the beneficiaries. At that time, some opposition party MLAs had claimed that ineligible applicants were being selected under the scheme.

Bijnor: As part of Ganga rejuvenation measures, the agriculture department is planning to organise a training session on organic farming for at least 1,000 farmers of Ganga delta area at Chandrashekhar Azad University in Kanpur on Wednesday.

According to experts, the programme would not only promote organic farming but also help in the rejuvenation of Ganga, which is often polluted due to rampant use of pesticides. They said that pesticides from the fields are washed away into the river during the monsoon season thereby both polluting it and affecting the aquatic life detrimentally.

River Ganga passes through 26 districts of UP covering 21 civic bodies and 1,026 village panchayats. Farming activities are widespread along the banks of the river. As the river is home to 712 dolphins from Bijnor to Ballia, around 788 gharials, several otters and a variety of other marine species. Hence, the government aims to boost the ecosystem along the river by promoting green and sustainable ways of farming.

Deputy director of agriculture department JP Chaudhary said, “A one-day training programme for farmers will be held in Kanpur on Wednesday. During the session, experts will impart training on cow-based farming which is also known as zero budget farming. It is very beneficial for them as they have to spend money only on rearing cows. Also, the waste products can also be used to grow crops. Such traditional practices will boost the fertility of the soil too.”

“Farmers from 1,026 villages will participate in the training programme. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present. In the first phase, we have shortlisted one farmer each from the villages located on the banks of Ganga. They will pass over the techniques to their counterparts,” he added.

Agricultural Technology Management Agency (Atma) project director Yogendrapal Yogi said, “From Bijnor, 22 farmers have been shortlisted. All the preparations have been made for the programme.”

According to officials, Ganga is one of the ten most polluted rivers in the world. The primary sources polluting it are garbage, plastic, sewage water, human waste and industrial effluents. Pesticides used for farming along the river also add to the pollution.

Yavatmal: Shiv Sena MP from Yavatmal-Washim, Bhavana Gawali , seems to have been totally sidelined from party programmes as a result of her differences with state forest minister and district guardian minister Sanjay Rathod .

Rathod is representing Digras assembly segment for the third time in a row while Gawali is a five-time MP. Last week, Gawali wasn’t among the party functionaries who accompanied Dushiyant Chaturvedi when he filed his nomination for the Yavatmal MLC bypoll. Even senior leaders and ministers of Congress and NCP were present.

Bhavana’s photos and her name have disappeared from party functions. Her supporters can now be found in the camp of Rathod.

The rift between them started over gaining supremacy in district politics. Gawali had in the past succeeded in stalling appointments of district chiefs for Yavatmal and Washim made by Rathod due to her proximity with Matoshree.

During the Lok Sabha election party chief and now chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had instructed Rathod to work for party candidate Gawali without any reservation. Still, Rathod kept a low profile during the poll while Gawali retained her seat by defeating Congress heavyweight Manikrao Thakre by a huge margin.

Later, Gawali remained absent from election campaign for Rathod and focused on her hometown Washim where she publicly declared support for Shiv Sena rebel. Gawali had then said she was even ready to face action from the party chief who had cautioned party workers against any rebellion.

When Sena formed the government with NCP and Congress in state, Gawali and her supporters rushed to Mumbai and registered their opposition to induction of Rathod as cabinet minister. She pleaded for giving cabinet berth to a neta from either Akola or Buldhana.

Gawali even objected to Rathod’s appointment as the guardian minister and instead lobbied for herself.

Meerut: Six days after the house of a woman, 40, was set on fire leaving her and five children injured-- two of them seriously-- police on Monday claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of an elderly-looking man. Claiming that Farooq was 55-year-old, police said that he set the house on fire after being “spurned by one of the daughters” of the woman, Rahmeen. Farooq was financially supporting Rahmeen, who was ditched by her husband eight years ago, police said.

On January 13, the 40-year-old woman and her five children suffered burns when their house was set on fire. Two children were rushed to a Delhi hospital in serious condition and one of them is still critical. The incident took place at Zahidpur village in Kharkhoda region of Meerut.

Rahmeen works as a labourer to support her family. The accused, now identified as Farooq, was an acquaintance of the family and used to regularly visit them. According to sources in the police department, Farooq liked one of the daughters of Rahmeen, but she was “interested in another youth from the neighborhood”.

“This irked Farooq who began holding grudge against the family and decided to take the extreme step of eliminating them,” a police officer said.

“Farooq wanted to control the family, but was recently spurned. Due to that he took the extreme step,” said Avinash Pandey, superintendent of police (rural).

“Farooq was seen leaving the area in CCTV footages taken from the vicinity. He was later detained as a suspect in the case and was thoroughly interrogated where he confessed to the crime,” the SP said.

165,['21/01/2020'],8 cities in Maharashtra among 100 in country to get new FM stations,"This story is from January 21, 2020

AURANGABAD: The Centre has announced the setting up of FM stations at 100 cities across the country. In Maharashtra alone, eight cities have been chosen — Hingoli, Shirdi, Satana (Nashik district), Nandurbar, Achalapur (Amravati district), Chiplun (Ratnagiri district) and Sironcha and Aheri ( Gadchiroli district ).

Public broadcasting agency Prasar Bharati has asked the nearest All India Radio (AIR) authorities to undertake the necessary process for setting up the FM stations.

Hingoli MP Hemant Patil, who had raised the demand for setting up the FM station in his constituency with the Centre, said the proposed facility would be useful for education and entertainment purposes. “The Hingoli constituency is spread over 460 sqkm across 11 talukas. It has considerable rural and tribal population. The FM station will help in reaching out with educational, agricultural, environmental and health-related content among other topics,” he said. Patil added the radio station at Hingoli is expected to come up by October. “The government is expected to make a necessary budgetary allocation to set up 100 FM stations during the Budget for 2020-21. Each FM station will have 100W transmitter which can cover a substantial radius around it if erected at a proper height,” the MP said.

The demand for FM station for Hingoli was placed on behalf of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) located at Tondapur in Kalamnuri taluka, which needs a community radio station to reach out to the masses.

Prasar Bharati has asked AIR authorities located nearest to the proposed FM stations to communicate the status of different pre-requisites — land required, conditions of rent agreement (if applicable), availability of power supply and approach roads etc. The public broadcasting agency has stated that the technical bids for procurement of 100W FM transmitters have been opened and are currently under technical evaluation. “After evaluation, the price bid would be opened. The procurement process of FM transmitters may take eight months,” Prasar Bharati has said.

The temple town of Shirdi witnesses a huge inflow of devotees every day and the proposed FM station can benefit them along with the residents. “The content to be disseminated by the FM station can be customised to suit the need of devotees. Information and updates related to the temple activities can be very useful,” said Sandeep Kokil , a private professional and Saibaba devotee.

Pradhuman Singh Tomar took up a spade to clean up the warehouse

INDORE: The sight of a dirty warehouse campus was irritating enough for food and civil supplies minister Pradhuman Singh Tomar , who took up a spade and gave it a Swachh makeover on Monday.

Tomar, who visited the warehouse, was visibly irritated with dry waste spread in the open campus. He took a spade and cleaned the area to some extent before wanting to talk to IMC commissioner. “We all should maintain cleanliness as lack of sanitation leads to breeding of dengue and malaria mosquitos,” Tomar told reporters. Tomar in November had cleaned a stinking nullah and a toilet in Gwalior and Shivpuri respectively and videos of the same had gone viral on social media. Following the incident, IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh instructed local staff to clean the area. “The warehouse belongs to MP Warehousing and Logistics Corporation (MPWLC) and it’s their responsibility to keep the campus clean. If we find lack of cleanliness next time, we will take appropriate actions against it,” Singh said. MPWLC regional manager CM Mishra told TOI, “The warehouse is our property but there are some houses next to the campus boundary-wall, which is not tall enough to prevent people from throwing garbage there. We have however issued instructions to maintain cleanliness in the area.”

Earlier, Tomar raises questions on 200 quintals of grain kept in ‘suspicious’ condition in the warehouse. He asked officials to investigate the matter and submit report in 10 days. The minister also visited a fair price shop in Maharana Pratap Nagar and found irregularities in operations. He asked officials to investigate records and stock of shop . TNN

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) has started an online file tracking system on pilot basis to keep a check on inward and outward movement of official documents .

Last year in July, Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole had announced sweeping reforms in the functioning of the university, including the e-office system. The file-tracking system is considered as the backbone of the e-office.

Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said over 300 university staffers have been imparted with necessary training as a part of adopting the file tracking system.

“The file tracking system will enable tracing the journey of any file, document or note right from its inward at any of the university departments till logical action is taken in response to it. The system will by default produce a time-log showing the time taken for the necessary action at every section of the university. The online reform, thus, will give an exact account of official time spent in responding to every internal or external communication,” he said.

The file tracking system is basically a web-based application to monitor the official pendency and assist in their hassle-free tracking for speedy disposal. The system offers a range of benefits such as indexing the communications and files, updating its status, tracking the movement of the communications and online records management.

Bamu authorities said the high-tech measure would ensure necessary accountability and transparency in the university functioning.

“The new system will ensure decisions get implemented in the least possible time required. It will also speed up implementations of different official communications related to different stakeholders,” a Bamu official said.

BIJNOR: A government-aided school in UP’s Bijnor district has suspended a social science teacher after his name cropped up in an FIR filed by local police against those who indulged in arson and rioting during anti-CAA protest on December 20. Afzal Qureshi was booked in Bijnor’s Nahtaur town for taking part in the “violent protest”.

The protesters turned violent in eight cities of Bijnor. The worst-affected was Nahtaur where two persons-- Suleman and Anas-- were shot dead. Soon after the violence, police filed 34 cases against 3,900 protesters in the entire district and arrested 149 of them. In Nahtaur alone, 39 people were named while 2,200 unnamed were booked for the arson. Qureshi was among those named in the FIR and was missing since then, police said.

When contacted, Nahtaur station house officer (SHO) Satya Prakash claimed, “Afzal Qureshi, a teacher in HMI College Nahtaur, was one of the masterminds of the protest. Police had registered a case against him soon after the violence. Since then, he is on the run.”

The protesters have been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). Some of them, who were seen indulging in violence, were also slapped with section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC.

The decision to suspend Qureshi was taken by the school management. Talking to TOI, principal of the college, Sayyad Bilal Zaidi, confirmed the suspension. He said, “There was winter vacation on December 20, the day violence erupted here. Later, we were told by police that Qureshi was named in an FIR in connection with the violence. Since then, he was continuously absent. We have suspended him.”

When contacted, district inspector of school Rajesh Kumar said the school management has informed him about the suspension.

170,['21/01/2020'],NRI bizman linked to Robert Vadra arrested,"This story is from January 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: C C Thampi, a Dubai-based NRI businessman, has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate during the weekend in a money laundering case against Congress president Sonia Gandhi ’s son-in-law Robert Vadra . The latter has already had more than 13 interrogation sessions with the ED in the past two years in connection with acquiring undisclosed properties in Dubai, London and some other foreign countries.

Thampi, as he had admitted before the ED investigating officers earlier, was introduced to Vadra by Sonia Gandhi’s personal assistant P P Madhavan . Thampi was managing Vadra’s alleged front entities in Dubai, including Skylight Hospitality FZE and Skylight Investment FZE that later purchased London properties and a villa in Dubai.

After investigative agencies started trailing Vadra’s connection with Thampi, the latter transferred his 100% shareholding in Skylight Investment FZE, which consists of 1 share of Dirham 1,50,000, to the son of his stepsister, Vadakkethala Cheru Geever, who now owns through this shell company, the London flat at 12 Ellorton House, Bryanston Square, worth Rs 26 crore, and the Dubai villa (E-74, Jumeirah) worth over Rs 14 crore.

The agency suspects these are benami properties of Vadra held in the name of Geever. A multi-agency probe by the Indian government in the past two years revealed that Skylight Investment FZE, now May Fair Investment FZE, had no real business activity and yet huge cash deposits were made in its account just before the purchase of the London flat and the Dubai villa.

Skylight Investment was renamed May Fair Investment FZE on March 30, 2013 soon after the income tax department searched premises of defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari in Delhi-NCR to trail the transactions. Bhandari had first purchased the London flat at Bryanston Square with alleged payoffs from a South Korean multinational conglomerate that had benefited from an oil contract with ONGC. This flat was later transferred to Skylight.

The latest provocation was Thampi evading ED questioning related to some alleged financial transactions routed through Cyprus that the agency suspects have been conducted on behalf of the Congress chief’s son-in-law. Thampi has also claimed during his earlier interrogation that Vadra had stayed at the London flat at 12 Bryanston Square, a fact the latter has denied.

According to information received by the ED from UAE authorities, May Fair Investment had till December 2010 declared assets of Dirham 94,83,893 (Rs 12 crore); a villa in Dubai for Dirham 107,41,996 (Rs 14 crore) and a London flat worth Dirham 202,25,889 (Rs 26 crore). May Fair Investment does not have any business activity and its bank account was opened on March 31, 2009 with AED 1,50,000 (Rs 19 lakh). All the assets acquired were through cash deposits in its accounts, sources said.

Vadra’s Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd in India is facing multiple money laundering cases in which the agency has already attached his Sukhdev Vihar house besides other assets worth over Rs 4.62 crore. Vadra was questioned last February related to these transactions and his association with Thampi. However, he had denied any knowledge of these transactions.

Thampi is facing other cases of Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) violations in purchase of agricultural land in Delhi-NCR and Kerala . In 2017, he was issued summons by the ED for acquiring about 900 acres of land for Rs 288 crore in violation of Fema rules. Three of his companies involved in the case include Holiday City Centre Pvt Ltd, Holiday Properties Pvt Ltd and Holiday Bekal Resorts Pvt Ltd.

“Thampi had acquired huge agricultural land in Palwal, NCR, and Gautam Buddha Nagar, UP, through the above mentioned firms, which he otherwise would not have been able to purchase, being an NRI,” a senior ED official said.

Meerut: Sweet shops in the city have been asked to put up boards stating that they don’t reuse food oil, in the backdrop of the Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) initiative through which the government has asked owners to collect reused cooking oil and send it for conversion to biodiesel. Also, the district authorities have asked officials to spread awareness about adulteration among government school students.

Archana Dheeran, FSDA designated officer of Meerut, said, “All the sweet shops in the city have been asked to put up display boards which read that they do not reuse cooking oil. The initiative is to promote the conversion of cooking oil to biodiesel. FSDA teams are now asking city shops to not reuse cooking oil more than three times – as the consumption of food items cooked with such oil can cause damage to the kidney, liver and even heart.”

Under the RUCO initiative, the collection and conversion of used cooking oil to biodiesel is being done by a Haryana-based company. According to sources, most of the shop owners either throw away used oil or sell it to rural areas.

FSDA authorities collected 517 samples during 2,783 inspections from April to December 2019, out of which reports for only 440 samples have been received. Out of these, 130 were found to be substandard, 44 unsafe and 73 misleading.

“Meanwhile, instructions have also been given to spread awareness among government school students about food adulteration. With this, they will be able to report such issues whenever they find anything amiss,” added Dheeran.

SAMBALPUR: Farmers on Monday blocked Padampur-Saraipali road at Lakhmara College chowk in Padampur of Bargarh district for more than three hours after their paddy could not be procured as the online registration of the farmers under the Paddy Procurement Automation System (P-PAS) had not been done.

The farmers started the road blockade by placing paddy bags and paddy-laden vehicles on the road at 10am. Vehicular movement was disrupted due to the agitation by the farmers. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded on either side of the road.

Farmer leader Hara Bania said, “The farmers had submitted all the documents with the Lakhmara primary agricultural cooperative society (PACS) for the online registration under P-PAS. However, due to official negligence, the registration of 308 farmers under the Lakhmara society had not been done. As a result, the farmers were barred from selling their paddy.”

He further said the farmers had several times drawn the attention of the authorities over the issue. However, their concern remained unheard and as a result the farmers were forced to resort to road blockade on Monday, he said.

“The farmers here earn their livelihood from paddy farming and it is the economic backbone but though we harvested paddy, we are now unable sell our produce. As the paddy is yet to be sold, the farmers are unable to pay their outstanding dues for tractor, pesticide and fertiliser, which they had borrowed for farming,” said an agitating farmer.

Police rushed to the spot to discuss with the agitating farmers. The farmers withdrew the road blockade at 1.30pm after the sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Padampur, P K Sahu discussed with them and assured them that he would talk to the departments concerned to solve the problem.

AURANGABAD: The applicants who are awaiting their driving licences and those seeking the renewal of their permanent licences will have to take the road safety pledge now. The office of Maharashtra Transport Commissioner has issued directives to this effect to all regional transport offices (RTOs) in the state.

The pledge which emphasises on the basic road safety rules such as wearing a helmet, avoid drinking and driving, and staying away from the road rage , has been framed by Mumbai-based advocacy group Public Concern for Governance Trust (PCGT).

Ana Saldanha, one of the trustees of PCGT on Monday said that the mandatory road safety pledge before issuing a driving license was expected to inculcate traffic sense among citizens.

“Traffic rules are easy to follow or break. Youths are particularly vulnerable to breaking them, which causes accidents. The mandatory pledge before getting a driving license will inform applicants of the basics road safety norms,” he said.

“We observed measurable outcomes of the initiative, following which the output of the project was shared with top authorities of the state transport department. The idea to administer a pledge was appealing by the officials, who later decided to make it a part of the process of issuing the driving license,” Saldanha said.

A senior RTO official said making the road safety pledge compulsory would bring down the road accidents.

KOLKATA: Ahead of Republic Day, security has been stepped up at the city airport, where flyers have to undergo a second round of frisking and detailed scanning of their footwear and hand bags. Given the additional checking, which is lengthening the queues, the airport authorities as well as airlines have asked passengers to report at least three hours in advance to ensure they don’t get late for boarding.For registered luggage, a second layer of manual checking has been introduced even after the bags have passed through x-ray. CISF officers said the tightened security measures were holding up flyers for at least an hour to 90 minutes before they could proceed towards security check-in. The enhanced frisking at the security check counters also led to long queues that almost reached the gates during the morning and evening peak hours.The safety measures have been tightened since Sunday after a red alert was issued to all “sensitive” airports in the country. The red alert will be in force till January 31, till any further order is given out. According to the protocol, the checking is starting right outside the airport gate, followed by manual frisking at multiple points inside the airport and a second round of scanning between the boarding gate and the aircraft in the airside area. “Strict security measures, including ladder point check, have been enforced at the airport. We request our esteemed passengers to report early & cooperate with the authorities. Any inconvenience caused is regretted,” tweeted the Kolkata airport authorities on Monday. “We have begun sending texts to flyers to report at least three hours early,” said an airline official.“We are organising intensive random checks in the city side of the airport, setting up check nakas at the approach to the premises. Any vehicle, seeming suspicious, are being stopped and checked thoroughly using under-view mirrors. The vehicles’ boot and interior are also being checked,” said a senior airport official. He added the bomb disposal squad and sniffer dogs have been posted outside the airport and two QRT vehicles stationed at two ends.The deployment of CISF has been double. Inside the terminal, over two dozen plainclothed personnel have been for random scanning of flyers on the go. Another checkpoint has been set up between the terminal boarding gate and the aircraft, where passengers are being stopped and their hand bags are being checked. “We have asked airline officials and CISF personnel to be courteous while asking passengers to cooperate.

179,['21/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh assembly passes bills paving way for three capital cities,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Y S Jaganmohan Reddy

VIJAYAWADA: Amid uproarious scenes, the Andhra Pradesh assembly on Monday night passed two bills paving way for three capital cities in the state, signalling the end of the road for the much-touted greenfield capital in Amaravati.

With the passing of the two bills, the YSRC government led by Y S Jaganmohan Reddy scored a huge political victory over former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu.

Unfazed by the ongoing protests by farmers in the capital city region in Amaravati, the government introduced the two bills for trifurcation of the capital. After the day-long discussion on both bills, the assembly passed the bills with voice vote after Speaker Tammineni Sitaram suspended 17 TDP legislators. TDP is now planning to stall the bill in the legislative council where it enjoys majority.

On Monday morning, the cabinet met ahead of the assembly session and approved the bills which were then discussed in the assembly Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting. After the BAC meeting, the bills were introduced in the assembly paving the way for the trifurcation of the capital.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath introduced the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions (APDIDAR) Act 2020.

Minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana introduced the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Act 2020 that will replace the CRDA with Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA).

The APDIDAR Act envisages three seats of governance in the state to be called as capitals. While the area under AMRDA will be called legislative capital, Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Area will be called the executive capital and Kurnool Urban Development Area will be deemed as the judicial capital.

The bill further proposed to locate the seat of legislature at Amaravati; Raj Bhavan, Secretariat and offices of heads of departments at Visakhapatnam; and to initiate steps to seek relocation of the principal seat of the high court at Kurnool and for the constitution of benches of the high court in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014.

According to the APCRDAR Act, the CRDA will cease to exist once it is passed. The areas under the APCRDA shall be deemed to be constituted as AMRDA. All the assets and liabilities both the current and contingent and bonds issued by the APCRDA with guarantee of the government shall stand transferred to and shall vest in AMRDA. The government will continue to be the guarantor for all loans availed by the APCRDA.

The government has made some key provisions in the bills to justify its policy of decentralised development. Apart from proposing three capitals for the state, the government has proposed to establish zonal planning and development boards. The government has also proposed a new package for farmers in the Amaravati capital region by extending payment of annuity for an additional five years at fixed amount per annum equivalent to the annuity of the 10th year. The government has also proposed to increase pension for farm labourers from Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 and equal package to farmers who hold assigned lands on par with regular farmers.

Akbaruddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: In a first such attack against its ally, MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi , without naming TRS, said his party can place on throne or dethrone any party.

“Let it be Congress or Telugu Desam (TDP) or these motor car drivers, they all know who has ensured they sit on their throne,” said Akbaruddin Owaisi at a rally in Tandur ahead of the January 22 municipal poll. Car happens to be TRS symbol.

“If the strength of MIM ( All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen ) is behind their thrones, they should realise that Majlis knows how to dethrone them as well,” said Akbaruddin.

“Some TRS leaders are saying AIMIM is an Old City party. Arey TRS ke dewano (TRS supporters), don’t we have MLAs in Maharashtra and Bihar? Don’t we have an MP in Maharashtra? Arey TRS walo, does your party have an MLA outside Telangana?”

“In Andhra Pradesh they speak Telugu right? Then go there and win a seat,” he said. If Akbaruddin Owaisi starts speaking, your clothes will be torn, and tyres will turn upside,” he said.

On January 18, his elder brother Asaduddin Owaisi said the party could field candidates from TRS-held seats in Bodan and Nizamabad in the next assembly polls.

“AIMIM candidates might win from Bodan and Nizamabad, too. After municipal elections a plan will be rolled out,” Asaduddin had said. In 2018, Bodan, Nizamabad (urban) and Nizamabad (rural) was bagged by TRS.

In Tandur, addressing a large gathering, where MIM is locking horns with TRS and Congress for the January 22 polls, Akbaruddin said the MIM has the power to bend authorities while drawing a reference to the last Congress chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, N Kiran Kumar Reddy.

“There used to be a chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, I don’t want to name him. In a public meeting, I said that he will be the Congress’s ‘akhri kiran’ (last ray). Wasn’t, he the last kiran? Where is he now, no one knows,” said the Chandrayangutta MLA.

“So please realise that the MIM has the power to bend anyone,” he said.

When Kiran Kumar Reddy was in power in 2013, Akbaruddin was jailed for 40 days for delivering a hate speech in Adilabad.

Later in his speech, Akbaruddin warned TRS directly and took pot-shots at animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav. “TRS khabardaar, apni zaban ko lagam doh, nahi to meri zaban chalne lageli (control your language or I will start speaking),” said Akbaruddin .

“KCR, KTR make them understand. There is a minister in Hyderabad, the Secunderabad MLA, who is saying MIM is an Old City party. Control your speech and talk according to your stature. If you have guts come and contest against me in Chandrayangutta,” said Akbaruddin.

181,['21/01/2020'],"LIC directed to pay Rs 30,000 for failure to pay insurance money","This story is from January 21, 2020

Representative image

KORAPUT: The district consumer disputes and redressal forum has pulled up the Koraput branch of the Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) of India for failing to pay the insured amount of Rs 30,000 to the nominee of a dead policy holder.

The forum, in its order pronounced on Monday, asked the LIC to pay the assured sum of Rs 30,000 with an interest of 6% per annum from April 6, 2016 within 30 days of the communication of the order.

The complainant Budra Pradhani is a resident of Pradhaniguda of Boipariguda block in Koraput district .

He said his father Baida Pradhani had bought an LIC policy bearing number 571394617 on July 22, 2006 and died on November 28, 2007 while the policy was in force.

However, Budra came to know of the policy in 2016 and applied for the assured amount on March 29, 2016. But the LIC authorities contended that any death intimation received after three years is barred by limitation and is not payable.

“As I was working as a labourer in Andhra Pradesh for 10 years from 2006 to 2016, I was unaware of the policy bought by my father. I came to know of it after returning to the village in 2016,” said Budra. “I had also produced a certificate obtained from the sarpanch of Chandrapada before the LIC authorities to substantiate my absence from the village,” he added.

Budra further said as he failed to get the assured amount from LIC, he approached the consumer forum to direct the opposition party to pay the sum with an interest of 9% and a compensation of Rs 50 per day from November 28, 2007.

After examining the case, verifying the documents and recording statements, the forum comprising its president Nibedita Rath and member Jyoti Ranjan Pujari, found the LIC guilty and directed it to pay the assured sum with an interest of 6% per annum.

“The complainant being the nominee is entitled to get the sum assured with interest. However, observing the peculiarity of the case, the forum is not inclined to grant interest from the date of the death of the policy holder but from the date of the filing of the case,” Rath said.

She added that the forum was not inclined to grant any compensation and cost in favour of the complainant as prayed for.

VADODARA: The teacher from Anand , who had allegedly murdered his wife in Chhota Udepur on January 18, was arrested on Monday.

The accused, Mukesh Zala , was held from his home in Anand where he had fled to with his two kids after killing his wife Alpa.

Police said that the couple had heated arguments over dinner which escalated to murder. “The couple had been going through a rough phase as Mukesh used to remain suspicious over Alpa’s behaviour and other issues,” said a police official.

On the night of January 18, Mukesh picked up an iron griddle to slit Alpa’s throat and also hit it on her head. After she collapsed, Mukesh fled from there with their two sons. “He was hiding in Anand from where our team arrested him and also found the couple’s children,” the police official added. The two sons aged six and eight years are now with Mukesh’s father, who also lives in Anand.

Mukesh and Alpa were going through tension as he used to get angry over petty issues like why she would not answer his phone calls and not cook food. Alpa had moved to Gadh Boriyad village in Naswadi taluka seven months back as she had been teaching at a primary school in nearby Khareda village. Earlier, she used to commute daily between Anand and Khareda.

183,['21/01/2020'],GN Mills Flyover: Load test to be reconducted,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Coimbatore: The national highway wing of the state highways department has revised the project proposal for the GN Mills Flyover after the load test conducted to determine the bearing capacity of soil failed.

The department had launched work to construct the 670-metre flyover at GN Mills junction at a cost of Rs 41 crore in March. Months after the test piles were constructed, the department conducted load test by placing sand bags over them.

The work was stopped a couple of months ago after the load test failed, a senior official said. “We were planning to lay 10-metre deep foundation. Now that the test has failed, we have decided to increase the depth to 15 metres,” he told TOI.

Even as they continue to wait for the Centre’s nod for the revised proposal, the department constructed test piles about a week ago. “We will test the piles once again in another 20 days. Construction work will continue only if the test results are satisfying,” the official said. “Even though the work to increase the depth for laying foundation would incur additional cost, we are confident of managing the additional cost. The additional cost is expected to be close to Rs 30 lakh,” the official said.

K Kathirmathiyon, a member of the road safety committee, flayed the department for the fiasco. “Ideally, the bearing capacity should have been found out during the soil test itself. But, it is surprising that the department missed it. It is a rare incident,” he said.

“Project estimate is prepared based on the soil test result. Making changes at the implementation stage will escalate the cost and cause delay,” Kathirmathiyon added.

Only 113 dolphins were sighted in the lagoon last year against 162 dolphins in 2018

BHUBANESWAR: As many as 146 dolphins were sighted in the Chilika during the annual dolphin census by the forest department on Sunday. “The exact number of adults and calves will be provided by the wildlife wing in a few days after a detailed analysis,” said Susanta Nanda, chief executive of Chilika Development Authority (CDA), here on Monday.

Only 113 dolphins were sighted in the lagoon last year against 162 dolphins in 2018.

Motorised boats were prohibited on the day of census work. Eighteen teams were deployed. Binoculars with GPS tracking systems were used for the first time in counting dolphins, forest official sources said. Result of dolphin census indicated population of 150+ for the first time in the Chilika. “Clear colonisation of newer areas gives hope for the future, Nanda tweeted. He said “This is only a vet estimate of CDA done round the year by using hydrophone. CDAs estimated population range was 133 to 172,” he added.

During their estimation through hydrophone, the CDA found these aquatic mammals at Magarmukh, Jahnikuda, Mahisa, Rajhans, Nalabana, Kalijugeswar, Malatikuda, Pathara, Samal Island, Kalijai Island, INS Chilika, Krishnaprasad Gada Jetty and Satapada Jetty.

The fresh census revealed that mammals are moving towards new areas in central and southern sectors near Kalijai island and Rambha areas. These areas were made free from prawn gheries, official sources said. Nanda said all pen cultures inside the lake have been removed. “CDA has reclaimed 160+ sq km of encroached area in the last two years. Thats almost 15% of the lake. Increased bird and dolphin population is mainly attributed to that,” he said, adding, “We can say the population is likely to increase in the next couple of years.

Schools in the city are flooded with requests for modifications in leaving certificate

NAGPUR: Beside the civic body, schools in the city are flooded with requests for modifications in leaving certificate, the next most important document after birth certificate to prove place and date of birth in view of government implementing National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

With principals and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials themselves confused, citizens, mainly Muslims, are in a fix. The main problem is a mismatch in records of NMC birth and death registration department and leaving certificate issued by schools.

Modification seekers are people who were admitted in schools based on verbal submissions regarding their date of birth (DoB) and those who passed out from Urdu and Hindi-medium or those run by gram panchyats and zilla parishad schools. These have their proof of address and identity as per NMC record.

At a time when most people did not have civic birth certificates, schools would record ‘1/7’ (July 1) as the day and month of birth for children while admitting them. Now this is not tallying with NMC records that are being referred to issue birth certificates as a measure to establish citizenship.

While DoB remains an issue, spelling, addition of a parent’s name and place of birth too are posing challenges for those having leaving certicates in Hindi.

“Over 90% students enrolled with us are seeking corrections,” said Ayaz Syed, principal of Gandhibagh’s Shivaji Night School set up in 1978. He added the first mismatch happens in leaving certificate and the board marksheet as formats are different.

Syed said, “Main reason for this panic is people never thought they would one day have to prove citizenship and went on to include names in school records as per their whim.” Right now, Syed said, the school was asking people to first get correction published in government gazette or bring a JMFC court order.

Even after getting this done, schools are not sure what kind of changes they are authorized to make.

At Mominpura, principal of Taj Baba Night School Sayyed Muzammil is in a dilemma when people come to him with a gazette notification. “We need clarity from the education department on this. We are getting 10 to 12 requests for including place of birth in TCs everyday. If it is not in school records, we can’t do it,” he said.

Deputy director (Education) Satish Mendhe told TOI no change can be made in the general admission register. “It amounts to forgery unless the government issues any guidelines. We have not received any request from schools,” he said. Mendhe defended school records saying parents submit undertaking at the time of admission and details are not accepted on verbal submissions.

Mahal’s Anjuman High School principal Nazra Patel said cases pertaining to surname, caste of father or grandfather and a different first name have been routine affair at her school. “We don’t want to harass parents but can’t go against norms,” she said.

NMC medical officer and sub-registrar Ateequr Raheman Khan said schools must permit certain changes as per his department’s records. “In some cases there is difference in month of birth. We have original records. Based on this, schools must let people change them,” he said. Similarly, Khan said married women were facing probem of name change. “In such cases, an alias is allowed,” he said.

The polls are going to be a litmus test for both Congress and BJP in proving their mettle in urban areas of Telangana, while TRS is exuding confidence of winning a lion’s share of municipalities and corporations.

The State Election Commission (SEC) said that since the campaigning had ended, no candidate should convene or hold or attend any public meeting or take out a procession. It also barred display of symbols and use of election paraphernalia by means of cinematography, television or any other modes.

SEC secretary Ashok Kumar said use of mobile phones and social media 48 hours prior to polling is also banned. “If any person deviates and campaigns, it is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with a fine or both,” the secretary warned.

According to doctors at the hospital, the child was admitted to ICU and put on ventilation and kept under observation for his multiple injuries in his brain. Later at night, the hospital informed police that the child had died.

A KMC team from Borough IX visited the spot. An electrical department official working at the KMC headquarters said the lamp post had become vulnerable and was supposed to be replaced. “The lamp post was past its expiry date and plans were on to replace it. We never thought the post would collapse , leading to the unfortunate death of a child,” the official said. He added the department was asked to conduct a health survey of other such lamp posts in the area and submit a report at the earliest. “We will soon replace posts, which have become weak,” he said.

“From locals, we learnt the boy was playing in front of his reltive’s home, when the KMC street lamp post snapped into two and fell on him,” said an investigating officer, adding a case of death due to negligence had been lodged at the Ekbalpore police station.

A local said, “The lamp post is a single-light long beam post. This could have happened to anyone.”

Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: The Congress party leader, Hardik Patel , filed a bail application in the city sessions court on Monday after he was arrested on Saturday evening on a warrant issued by the court for not attending the trial in sedition case here.

The court is likely to hear the bail application on Tuesday.

After his arrest from near his native Viramgam, Patel was sent to judicial custody by additional sessions judge B J Ganatra till January 24.

In his bail plea, Patel has proposed to give an undertaking that now onwards, he will take utmost care and will regularly attend the court proceedings without fail. He will never tender any adjournment application to delay the trial. Patel has claimed that he honours court proceedings and that he has never tried to protract the trial.

Patel has also said that he undertakes to examine the witness whenever the court calls him, and that no witness would go back the way a government undersecretary, Vijay Badheka, returned on Saturday without being cross-examined. He expressed regret that the witness had to return from the court without he being cross-examined. Patel has proposed to pay for the witness’s travel charges.

On Saturday, the court issued an arrest warrant against Patel on a request by public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt for Patel’s continued absence in courtroom during the trial of the 2015 sedition case. Patel had sought exemption from appearance during the proceedings on the ground that he had to attend a social function, but the court rejected his application.

Patel, the former convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), is facing the trial along with two others on sedition charges for inciting violence during the Patidar quota agitation in August 2015.

CAA FAllout: A copy of the summons sent by Mangaluru cops

Kasaragod: Hundreds of people in Kasaragod district have received summons from Manguluru police asking them to appear before officials in Mangaluru and assist the probe into the violent anti-CAA protests that rocked the city on December 19, which left two persons dead in police firing. The notices, sent by assistant commissioner of police of Mangaluru city crime record bureau, have specified the date and time of their appearance, and warns the Kasaragod residents that failure to appear would be construed as “evading the investigation” and invite “further legal procedure”.

Thousands of people, including traders, fisherfolk, students and bank employees travel to and fro daily to Mangaluru from several towns like Manjeshwar in Kasaragod district. Manguluru is the biggest city in the vicinity and caters to their medial and commercial needs.

The majority of those who received the summons belong to a particular community and they seem to have been chosen based on their cell phone location on the day of the riots in Mangaluru. Several of these people contacted by TOI were incredulous on being implicated in the violence. “I run a crusher unit here and I was in Mangaluru on that day as part of some lathe work of the machinery; I knew there was some protests going on the city but I returned to Kasaragod soon after my work got over,” said Chengala resident Ahammed Ashif. He has been asked to appear before Mangaluru police officials on January 21. When he called another friend, from another community, who was also in Mangaluru on December 19, he discovered that his friend hasn’t got the notice.

Muhammed Kunhi, a fish trader from Manjeshwar, said many people from the fish-selling fraternity have got the notice. “We depend on Mangaluru to procure fish and earn our livelihood, but now we are being termed rioters just because we were there in the city on that day, that too many hours before the violence broke out,” he said.

As reported by TOI in its December 28 edition, a Karnataka government circular issued during the riots asking colleges in Dakshina Kannada district to keep a tab on students in Kerala had kicked up a storm. “They are falsely implicating innocent people; worse, they are insinuating that people from Kerala were behind the riots in Mangaluru. This is dangerous and questions the right of free movement of people even to neighbouring places,” said Kasaragod district panchayat member Ali Harshad Vorkady, who has taken up the issue with the authorities here. Vorkady said, in his estimate, around 1,800 people in Kasaragod district have got the notice from Manguluru police so far.

Incidentally, Rameela Moyyaddi from Hosabettu in Manjeshwar too has got a notice, though she was nowhere near Mangaluru on that fateful day. On Dec 19, Rameela’s husband Bawa Moyyaddi, a fish seller, had gone to procure fish from the city and had taken her cell phone, as he often does. “On getting the notice I was shocked, but later I came to know that many people like me have been served notice, even though we did not cross the state border that day,” she said.#

Hussain Sagar lake

HYDERABAD: Upset with the affidavit filed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) that raised more questions than it answered, a division bench of Telangana high court headed by Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan on Monday asked GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar to resign if he could not protect city lakes .

The bench was furious as the GHMC — in its counter in a PIL based on media reports about miserable condition of Kukatpally lake and its adjacent pond — contended that it had no power to appoint employees at lakes to prevent dumping of garbage. The bench then referred to TOI reports highlighting how several lakes were being encroached and the CJ told officials to go through the newspaper if they were not aware of what was happening under their watch.

“Lakes are the lifeblood of humans and if they are destroyed, Hyderabad will become a Jaisalmer in the next 20 years,” the CJ warned. “This Rajasthan city faces such water shortage that officials have asked people to take bath only once in 15 days. If you want to convert Hyderabad into Jaisalmer, then you are welcome,” the CJ said.

The CJ also spoke about lakes in Hyderabad and in neighbouring Bangalore where effluents clandestinely released into them were turning into foam, making it dangerous for people.

The bench was also irked as GHMC counter claimed that lakes were regularly cleaned but no evidence was attached to substantiate it. Asking the GHMC commissioner to file a fresh counter, it posted the case to February 7.

AHMEDABAD: Loan sharks have been spreading their fins in the city. In the past one month, seven harried borrowers have lodged complaints with police, alleging harassment by moneylenders. Recently, there has also been a spike in cases of borrowers taking their lives, frustrated with their inability to repay hefty loan and interests.According to police sources, the loan sharks active in the city have been demanding up to 40% monthly interest from the borrowers. “The lenders can go to any extent to extort the hefty interest amount. From abduction to torture before family members, they resort to all illegal methods to terrorize the borrowers,” said a senior police officer.“Fed up with constant torture, people have been coming to us to file complaints. Though we have limited options, cases are being filed under sections of extortion and the money lending act, and in cases where the victim has committed suicide, under Section 306 (abetment to suicide),” the officer added.A furniture showroom owner in Chandkheda had paid double the amount he had borrowed, but got caught in the vicious circle of high interest rate. Unable to cope with the pressure and constant harassment by the lenders, he decided to end his life by jumping into the Narmada canal.

KOLKATA: Angered by the multi-level checking going on at the Kolkata airport , owing to red alert issued ahead of Republic Day, a 28-year-old youth threw his bag at a security officer on Sunday, saying “the bag contained bomb”.

Pradipta Bandopadhyay was about to board a flight to Bangalore, where he works at a private firm, around 5.30pm on Sunday, when he was stopped by a security officer of SpiceJet before entering the aircraft SG658. The officer told him to open his hand bag and asked him if there was any hazardous or dangerous bag. “The passenger had already undergone multiple screening. At being told to open his bag yet again, he possibly lost his cool and threw his bag at the officer, saying it contained a bomb. The officer isolated him, prevented him from boarding the flight and called the CISF officers,” said a senior airport official.

A SpiceJet spokesperson said when the flyer told the staff member that his hand bag had a bomb in it, the security staff lerted the CISF and local police and handed him over to them. Officers at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International police station arrested him under sections of IPC and Safety of Civil Aviation Act for spreading panic. He was later released on bail. “No restricted item was found in his luggage. But going by the protocol, we had to seize the luggage and detain the man before handing him over to police,” an airport official said.

This was not the first time a passenger had been pulled out of a flight for making “threatening” remarks. On January 11, a Mumbai-bound Air Asia flight from Kolkata had to return after a 25-year-old drunk woman claimed she was carrying a bomb. She was later arrested though nothing dangerous was found on her. On November 2018, a 21-year-old youth on a Mumbai-bound flight was arrested after he posted a photograph of himself with his face covered with a handkerchief. A snooping fellow passenger spotted the words, ‘terrorist’ and ‘destroy’, in the photo caption and alerted the cabin crew, following which the youth was handed over to police.

199,['21/01/2020'],Leaving Congress biggest blunder on my part: Dharmapuri Srinivas,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Senior politician and TRS Rajya Sabha member Dharmapuri Srinivas , popularly known as DS, said on Monday that leaving Congress was the biggest blunder of his 40-year long political career. The 71-year-old three-time MLA and former minister quit Congress on July 2, 2015, a year after Telangana was granted statehood by the then UPA government at the Centre in June 2014.

Days later, Srinivas joined TRS to realise the goal of what he termed a “bangaru (golden) Telangana.” However, his honeymoon with the ruling TRS did not last long. In the last couple of years, his relationship with TRS leadership strained further as he developed differences especially with former Nizamabad MP and chief minister’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha. His younger son Dharmapuri Arvind is a BJP leader and represents Nizamabad in the Lok Sabha after defeating Kavitha in the 2019 elections.

Srinivas said he resigned from Congress owing to differences he had with the then Congress incharge of Telangana affairs Digvijaya Singh who, he said, had insulted him. Srinivas had served as the state Congress president twice and also as a minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh. He was the president of Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee when the party assumed power under the leadership of late YS Rajasekhara Reddy in 2004.

Ahead of the municipal elections, Srinivas dared the TRS leadership to take action against him. Speaking to newsmen in Nizamabad, he also took an indirect dig at chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao saying “father, son and daughter have become golden” in the name of achievign a golden Telangana.

He lambasted district TRS leaders for talking against him. He was reacting to the comments of minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy who, earlier in the day, said Srinivas did not do anything for Nizamabad despite serving as a minister, PCC chief and being in political life for 40 years. “Some people are asking me as to what I have done in the last 40 years. First, they should tell what they have done all these years.”

Srinivas said he allocated his entire MLA fund for a railway project in Nizamabad and also allocated funds for a sewer network. “I am ready to donate my house for a medical college building.” The former Congress chief said he did not speak on various issues earlier as he did not deem it right on his part to rake up controversies unnecessarily.

He appealed tothe people to vote for those who strive for development of Nizamabad.

HYDERABAD: Amid speculations of a close fight and horse-trading to grab chairperson and mayor posts in some municipalities and municipal corporations after the counting on January 25, major political parties are bracing up to shift elected councillors and corporators to ‘safer’ locations.

Sources said the parties are arranging high-end buses to places like Goa, Bengaluru and Kerala to shift the elected members to stop poaching by their rivals.

Though the election of municipal chairpersons and mayors is indirect, a close fight is on cards in about 30 municipalities in the erstwhile districts of Mahbubnagar, Adilabad, Nalgonda , Khammam and Nizamabad. TRS, Congress and BJP are seized of this.

The three major parties are not only wary of poaching in some of municipalities, but are also guarded about groups which could hamper their candidates’ prospects. In such cases, independent candidates and parties like All-India Forward Bloc are likely to play a key role in securing chairperson and mayor posts, sources said.

While TRS administered an oath to its candidates while issuing form-B that they would abide by the leadership’s decision on chairperson and vice-chairperson posts, Congress extracted affidavits from its candidates that they would be loyal to the party after getting elected. “We have been asked to not plan any programme or function till the end of January as we may have to attend camps if required,” a TRS contestant from Mancherial told TOI.

Before and during nominations, there were instances where TRS and Congress traded charges that their leaders were being poached. In areas like Peerzadiguda and Gajwel, leaders of TRS and Congress switched sides and came back to their parent parties.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat education department is likely to begin enrolling students under the Right To Education (RTE) Act at private schools in the state by March, said sources. The department will soon start preparing a database of the number of seats available at such schools in Class I, sources added.

The locations of schools will be mapped for students and parents to access online. The RTE Act defines the limits of a neighbourhood school, which can be at a maximum distance of 6km from the student’s habitation. “Only schools which within this limit will be shown while applying online,” said an official privy to the development. He said that only after gathering details of the total number of seats for Class I, will details about the seats under the RTE quota be announced. The RTE Act reserves 25% of seats at self-financed schools for students from economically disadvantaged groups.

In Ahmedabad, the district education officer (DEO) has set up a team to gather school details such as location, fees and number of seats, among others, according to sources.

Last year, more than two lakh RTE admission forms were received at 10,000 schools and government centres confirmed accepting 1.5 lakh of them after scrutiny. About 1.17 lakh seats were available under the RTE Act quota for the 2019-20 academic year. After the first round, admission was given to 98,859 students. tnn

203,['21/01/2020'],"DTC misses bus, but Delhi Metro keeps transport going","File photo of DTC bus at a bus stand

NEW DELHI: At the bus shelter adjacent to Pearey Lal Bhawan on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, Sanjay Kumar, an office assistant in a private firm, strains his eyes to read the route number on the approaching Delhi Transport Corporation bus. He sighs as he notices that it is not running on route 502, which would have taken him home to Mehrauli. Kumar settles back on the steel seat, rubbing his hands for warmth on the chilly January evening. “The bus might come 10 minutes or in 50 minutes, there is no way of knowing,” he shrugs.“I prefer travelling by buses because the stops are close to my home and office, but their frequency has been worsening each year,” Kumar said. “I do travel by Delhi Metro , but only in a hurry. My bus fare is Rs 15, while I have to shell out Rs 36 for the metro, something I can’t afford on regular basis.”While Delhi Metro ferries approximately 30 lakh passengers a day, the combined DTC and Cluster scheme buses carry 42 lakh. Many, like Kumar, opt for bus travel, but the dwindling fleet strength is affecting their commute time. While Delhi needs around 11,000 buses, it has 5,789 on the ground.When the Aam Aadmi Party assumed power in February 2015, the DTC fleet numbered 4,712 and the Cluster scheme had 1,402. The number of DTC buses fell to 3,781 with ageing vehicles being scrapped, and despite floating and re-floating tenders, the company has been unable to induct new buses.AAP had promised before the last assembly polls that it would add ‘at least 5,000 new buses in five years’. The notable addition has instead been in the Cluster fleet, where the strength has gone up from 1,402 to 2,208, the new vehicles being part of the 1,000 standard-floor buses scheduled for induction from August 2019.In this discouraging scene for bus riders, the only silver lining has been the free rides provided by the state government for women. “There has been a dip in our family’s transport expenses,” iterated Jamaluddin in Mustafabad. “The government is bringing more buses and with their arrival travelling should become more comfortable.”Ambedkar Nagar resident Santosh Kumari similarly reported, “I’m saving at least Rs 500 a month thanks to the free bus rides. My daughter prefers to travel by Delhi Metro even though it is costlier. We hope train rides also become free for women.” This polls, AAP has promised 11,000 buses and total 500km metro network, apart from free travel for students and senior citizen, an assurance mirrored by Congress. BJP has committed to inducting 5,000 electric buses for public transport if it comes to power.With the bus system hobbled, Delhi Metro has taken on the daily onus of moving Delhiites. It has grown from a network of 193km to 349km and from 147 stations to 253 stations in the last five years, adding three new corridors — the Pink, Magenta and Grey Lines. At 2019-end, the Phase IV of its network expansion was also cleared.The extended connectivity has been particularly welcomed in Najafgarh and Matiala constituencies. The Grey Line, slated to touch the Dhansa border, is functional up to Najafgarh. Neeraj Singh, who lives in Jaffarpur Kalan in Najafgarh, was quick to credit the local MLA and Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot for ‘fulfilling his promise’ of delivering Delhi Metro to Najafgarh. “Once it reaches Dhansa border, things will become even better for us,” Singh said. “Many people who otherwise have to take buses and autos to exit the area can now ride a train.”While Delhi Metro has reached almost all parts of the city now, last mile connectivity is still elusive. Before the 2015 polls, AAP had promised effective connectivity to reduce the number of crimes against women through a combination of shared autos, metro feeder services and e-rickshaws. Delhi Metro is yet to induct new feeder buses due to a fund crunch, while lack of regulation has turned the profusion of e-rickshaws into a traffic problem.“There should be multiple facilities, such as two-wheeler services or e-cycles depending on the need of the area,” suggested Atul Goyal, president of United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an umbrella body of RWAs. Goyal added that with proper norms, e-rickshaws can be incorporated into the local area plans.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state cabinet has decided to inform the registrar general of census, who comes under the Union home ministry, that Kerala will not implement the National Population Register ( NPR ), a move that is bound to set the LDF government, which has been in the forefront of the anti-CAA movement , on a collision course with the Centre.“The decision has been taken to clear public apprehensions and to maintain law and order in the state. The state government has the Constitutional responsibility to ensure these two,” said a statement issued by the cabinet.However, the state government clarified it will fully cooperate with normal census procedures. “We will inform the census directorate that certain questions which will go with the census will not be asked here. The state government will ask enumerators to exclude two questions: date of birth of respondents and details of their parents from the census questionnaire,” said AC Moideen, minister for local self-government.The state government is of the view that NPR is a prelude to National Register of Citizens (NRC). “People fear the aim of creating such a register. We believe that this would create severe unrest among people. Already the states, where this has been implemented, are witnessing severe law and order issues,” the statement said.The intelligence wing of state police has reportedly warned that the implementation of NPR or NRC would create severe tension in Kerala. District collectors have also reported that census process will be severely affected if we go ahead with NPR, the statement explained.The Kerala government has already filed a suit gone against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court, while the state assembly passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to withdraw CAA.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73467702,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161690,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/its-official-kerala-will-have-own-census-but-no-npr/articleshow/73451641.cms

NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team of Delhi Police has started a counselling programme for the rioters arrested during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. Following a court order, they are being made to attend classes where they are told about the provisions of the new law. On Sunday, the ‘teacher’ also fielded questions from the ‘students’ in a two-hour session.The main query of the 15 bailed men was whether they would be deported if they failed to provide proof of their citizenship. Police sources said the men mostly claimed to be daily wage labourers, here in Delhi to earn a livelihood in the factories in north-east Delhi.According to an officer, one of the men admitted that he had not known about CAA at the time of the violent protests, but had learnt about it from peers after his arrest. Like others, his concern was about being deported or sent to a detention camp.The cops had hired a legal expert to explain the provisions of the Act to the men to clear any misunderstanding they might have. They were also encouraged to bring their family members or anyone else to learn more about what the amendment to the Citizenship Act entailed.An officer said, “We also handed the men copies of the Act so they could read about its provisions themselves. The language was simplified to enable them to understand it.” Some religious leaders were also roped in advise the rioters to avoid violence while protesting.The men who were arrested after the violent demonstrations in Seelampur and Daryaganj in December last year were asked to clear the doubts people known to them might have about the provisions.Delhi Police has arrested 100 people in connection with the violence, and efforts are being made to identify others who had gone on a rampage. Most were nabbed from Seelampur and Jafrabad.

HYDERABAD: The campaign ended on Monday, but on a bitter note with the opposition parties projecting police as “mere tools” in the hands of the ruling TRS. Some netas even went to the extent of playing out their phone conversations with police higher-ups.

Nizamabad MP Arvind Dharmapuri of BJP and Sangareddy legislator T Jagga Reddy were notable in playing out their phone conversations much to the joy of crowds at their rallies.

Arvind made the crowds listen to his conversation with the ‘commissioner of police’ wherein he was arguing as to why BJP was being asked to change the rally route map of its MLA Raja Singh in Nizamabad where he had gone to campaign. Arvind charged police with giving preference to AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi . The Hyderabad MP during his campaign in Armoor urged people to defeat BJP and also said he was sad that his ‘sister’ (referring to former Nizamabad MP Kavitha Kalvakuntla) had lost the Lok Sabha polls.

In Sangareddy, Jagga Reddy played out his phone conversation apparently with a police official. “You targeted me and I am ready for anything,” he told the police official whom he did not name. IT minister KT Rama Rao charged BJP with stirring communal passions. Arvind, however, clarified: “I am not against Muslim brothers and sisters. I am against AIMIM.”

207,['21/01/2020'],MLA Ashish Jaiswal moots bamboo as farm fence to fight wild boar menace,"This story is from January 21, 2020

MLA Ashish Jaiswal

NAGPUR: To deal with wild boar menace which threatens farms on periphery of forests in Ramtek, MLA Ashish Jaiswal is finalizing a plan to find a sustainable solution. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Jaiswal shared his plan to start bamboo plantations on a large scale on affected farms. He says this will serve both economic and farming interest of the ryots.

Jaiswal says the sturdy bamboo plantations can withstand the marauding wild boars if grown as a fence. Later, the bamboo can be sold which will bring additional income for the farmer.

“I will be ready with a detailed plan soon which will be presented to the government. Wild boars are a big menace for farmers and the damage caused is a serious issue,” he said.

Last week, a pack of wild boars attacked a farmer family in Chargaon village of Ramtek when they were working on their field. Their 20 year-old daughter lost her life after she jumped into an open well while trying to escape from the rampaging beasts. This incident led to an outrage among locals who have seen their crops regularly damaged by the boars.

Though the state government allows culling under certain circumstances, Jaiswal’s draft plan is looking for a more sustainable and permanent solution.

State government funds will be sought for the project said Jaiswal. “It could be part of the employment guarantee scheme. Farmers will be engaged in planting bamboo and EGS will ensure that they don’t loose out on their livelihood,” said Jaiswal.

The fact that Jaiswal is close to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is viewed as an added advantage. Jaiswal contested the assembly polls in October as an independent candidate after the Ramtek seat went to BJP, courtesy a pre-poll deal with his party Shiv Sena. Though Jaiswal was technically a “rebel” candidate, he has always shared good relations with Thackeray.

208,['21/01/2020'],Badminton set for major changes with synthetic shuttles,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Hyderabad: In a move that is likely to lead to major changes in badminton, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) has approved the use of synthetic feather shuttlecocks at its sanctioned international tournaments at all levels from 2021. At present, feathers from goose and duck are used to manufacture shuttles around the world.

In a statement, BWF said that various prototypes, developed with technological cooperation of Yonex, were tested at three tournaments last year. It added that the synthetic variety is more durable and economical compared to the traditional shuttle and that it has similar flight and performance.

It will, however, not be mandatory to use only this variety once it’s introduced next year. Initially, hosts of tournaments will be given a choice between the synthetic and traditional variety. The federation is hoping that synthetic shuttles will become popular with time.

In an official statement, BWF secretary general Thomas Lund called it a positive step for the sport. “The vision is to ensure long term sustainability of badminton and become less dependent on natural feathers for shuttlecocks,” he said. “We heard from some elite players involved in the testing that they were able to adjust to slight variances between synthetic and traditional shuttlecocks quite quickly.”

Surprisingly, chief coach of the Indian badminton team, Pullela Gopichand, said he was unaware about the development. “Without testing it, I cannot comment on how it behaves,” he told TOI. “But I feel the skill aspect of the game may be lost. We may not have the soft touch, cuts or drops. It will be a different shift in the sport. The game may be more power reliant. We need to adapt to it, there is no other way.”

The name ‘shuttlecock’ originated in the 1570s in England. The one in use now is made from 16 overlapping feathers. In China, goose feathers are used while in India white duck feathers are used. In every shuttle, feathers from only one of the wing (left or right) are used.

Former India international Chetan Anand, who runs his own academy, said, “I think too many changes are bad for the game. Badminton may change entirely because of this introduction. If there is not much difference between the feather and synthetic variants, I don't have a problem.”

File photo

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday accepted the Centre’s proposal to take control of embattled real estate giant Unitech Limited and paved the way for a new board of directors, headed by retired IAS officer Yudvir Singh Malik, to take over the management and initiate steps to complete the housing projects in which over 30,000 people have invested.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah also approved the names of ex-CMD of NBCC Anoop Kumar Mittal, chairman of HDFC Credila Financial Services Pvt Ltd Renu Sud Karnad, CMD of property developer Embassy Group Jitu Virwani, MD of Mumbai-based Hiranandani Group Niranjan Hiranandani, chartered accountant Girish Kumar Ahuja and former MD and CEO of IDBI Bank B Sriram for appointment as directors of the company.

The court, however, turned down the plea of the present management headed by the Chandra family that one of the family members be also made part of the board to facilitate management of the company. It directed the newly constituted board of directors to prepare the resolution framework of the company within two months and place it before the court.

Responding to the Centre’s stand that it will not infuse any money in Unitech, advocate Pawanshree Agrawal, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, and homebuyers’ lawyer M L Lahoty pleaded the court to direct the finance ministry to provide some funds to complete the projects. Agrawal told the court that the new management should also be directed to dispose of encumbered properties of Unitech to raise funds.

The bench asked why the government cannot release money for its newly set up stress fund for real estate sector but the attorney general responded that funds cannot be released for projects under litigation. The court said it would take that aspect later after the new management took charge of the company.

The court also agreed with all conditions put by the Centre to take over the management, which includes appointment of a retired SC judge to supervise the resolution framework finalised by the proposed board of directors and that the board be empowered to take steps to raise money for completion of projects.

The other conditions said the board be allowed to raise funds due from homebuyers and to sell unsold inventory of stocks and make unclaimed inventory available for re-selling. But the court said homebuyers could be asked to pay money only when after construction.

The court also stayed all proceedings against Unitech in tribunals and various courts for two months but made it clear that construction work going on in various projects would not be stopped due to change in management. The court also said it will not keep monitoring the functioning of the company under new management saying, “We will leave it to the commercial wisdom of the board of directors to take a decision.”

The demonstrators urged people to fight against all kinds of discrimination

NEW DELHI: Different student groups from across the country held a protest march under the banner of ‘ Young India ’ from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar on Monday. They raised slogans against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Addressing the participants, activist Harsh Mander said that it was exactly 73 years ago on January 18, 1948, that on the call of Mahatma Gandhi , lakhs had come out on the streets to show their support for Muslims in the country. A similar development is taking place again to ensure that nobody faces discrimination, he added.

“Love is the soul of the Constitution. Protesters are soldiers of love and Constitution and they have succeeded in stopping those whose attempt was to divide the nation,” he added.

“Students’ groups and unions associated with us have already held protests against CAA and NRC at Mallapuram, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Pune, Ahmedabad and other places. We have also conducted Preamble reading sessions in several colleges,” the Young India collective stated.

“Young India campaign unites the students and is aimed at protecting the Constitution,” said N Sai Balaji, AISA national president.

Members of Jamia Coordination Committee, ANHAD, JNU Students’ Union, Shaheen Bagh Protest Committee (United Youth Brigade) and others also joined the forum in its appeal to the Supreme Court of India to strike down the CAA when it comes for hearing on January 22.

Dipankar Bhattacharya of CPIML said: “No one has a problem in giving citizenship to refugees. But today they are dividing on the basis of religion, and tomorrow they’ll do it on the basis of caste and gender.”

Former JNU student and activist Umar Khalid took a jibe at the government and said that “despite bad economy the factory of lies was doing good in the country.”

Stating that protesters “have learnt equality from Ambedkar and harmony from Gandhi,” Khalid asked them to come out on January 30 and form a human chain at Connaught Place to mark the death anniversary of Gandhi.

HYDERABAD: Lack of response to postal ballot from officials drafted for election duty has come as a rude shock to the State Election Commission. Only 8,000 odd employees of the over 44,000 employees deployed on poll duty have applied for postal ballot.

Officials said that while it is up to the government employees to decide whether they will cast their vote or not, SEC secretary M Ashok Kumar has appealed to ‘on poll duty’ employees and police personnel to utilise the ‘Te-Poll’ software to fill application form VII, which needs to be submitted in person or through online to get the postal ballot.

Ashok Kumar told TOI that during these elections, over 44,000 employees had been drafted for election duty. “But, only 8,000 have applied for the postal ballot. It has been observed that response from the polling officials is lukewarm,” he said.

Officials also did not rule out the possibility of a majority of on-poll duty employees not being the voters of urban local bodies, which are going to polls on January 22.

Many of these could be voters of Greater Hyderabad, Khammam and Greater Warangal urban local bodies which are not going to polls on January 22.

“Of course, there could be employees who have not bothered to apply for postal ballot. But, there is still time and we hope that the postal ballot numbers will increase,” an official said.

People, who find their votes already been cast, can demand and cast a tender vote. If the percentage of tender votes is more than 0.1% of the total votes polled, SEC would take a call on conducting a fresh poll in that particular polling booth, officials said.

A CCTV grab of the suspect who is said to have planted the bomb.

MANGALURU: The international airport at Mangaluru was put on high alert on Monday after an “IED-like bomb” was found in the morning inside an unattended laptop bag at a ticket counter near one of the departure gates and an IndiGo flight call-back in the afternoon following a threat call. The bomb was defused in the evening in a controlled explosion.

CISF personnel had spotted the unclaimed bag around 8.45am. They immediately cordoned off the area and reported the incident to the police. The improvised explosive device (IED) was found packed in an iron box that contained a timer and wires, and it had about 1.5kg of silver powder used for making crackers.

CISF claimed that a tall lanky youth, wearing a baseball cap, seen in the airport CCTV footage was the suspect. The accused placed the bag near the ticket counter, took the escalator that leads to the parking area and exited the terminal and boarded an auto rickshaw, CISF authorities said.

Mangaluru police commissioner PS Harsha said three teams have been formed to trace the suspect.

After nearly nine hours of tense drama, the bomb disposal squad managed to put the device into a cooling pit and defuse it.

Though passenger services at Mangaluru International Airport remained unaffected after the IED scare, an IndiGo flight bound for Bengaluru was held back after the terminal manager received a call about a bomb placed onboard the aircraft. The authorities deplaned 126 passengers and subjected them to thorough checking. MIA director VV Rao said the flight, scheduled for 3pm departure, took off at 7.20pm after receiving an ‘all-clear’ from the authorities.

Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai said police have gathered clues about the person suspected to have left the IED-laden backpack at the airport.

Narayana said the absence of KCR from the poll campaign was an indirect acknowledgement by him that his government has failed to deliver on promises. He reminded that KCR had announced in December 2014 that he would not seek votes if his government fails to provide drinking water to all households through taps. “Since the promise remained unfulfilled, KCR personally did not seek votes although he deputed his son and party leaders to beg for votes,” he pointed out.

The decision to provide ARPs was based on the results of the learning outcome exams declared last month. In Bhadpura block 64.7% of students scored less than 50% marks, followed by Meerganj (58.9%) and Majhgavan (57.8%). Of the 64.7% students in Bhadpura, 32.4% failed the test.

In Bareilly district, 92,116 students had appeared in the learning outcome exams in November. Of the total students, 44.49% got C, D and E grades (below 50% marks), said education department officials. Of the 44.49% of students who scored C, D and E grades mostly belonged to Bhadpura block.

However, the maximum number of students who secured A+ grade (80% to 100% marks) belonged to schools in Bithri Chainpur block with 34.1%, followed by Alampur Jafrabad block at 31.7%, said officials.

Basic shiksha adhikari Tanuja Tripathi said, “We have got school-wise and subject-wise data of students who did not perform well. They will very soon start getting remedial classes during school hours. The remedial classes, which will look into areas where the children are weak, will continue till February — when students will appear for the second learning level exams.”

District Institute of Educational and Training (DIET) conducted training of teachers for giving remedial classes, added Tripathi.

Anil Chaubey, a member of the state resource group, said, “We will organise a meeting this week, wherein we will allot ARPs to schools for supportive supervision. ARPs, along with headteachers, will draw a plan of action to improve the performance of students. Thereon, we will hold a meeting in the last week of every month to check the progress made by remedial classes.”

According to officials, the next learning level outcome test will be held on February 14. Last year, only students from Classes V to VIII wrote the test, but in February, nearly 2.25 lakh students from Classes III to VIII will take the test.

218,['21/01/2020'],"Delhi assembly polls: Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP talks collapse over symbol, CAA","This story is from January 21, 2020

Manjinder Singh Sirsa

NEW DELHI/PATIALA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will not contest the Delhi assembly polls this time after its seat-sharing negotiations with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed on Monday.

The seat-sharing talks between SAD and BJP started showing signs of collapsing on Monday evening, according to sources, after BJP insisted on Akali candidates contesting the poll on the ‘lotus’ symbol. It also wanted SAD to accommodate an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) turncoat on one of the four seats that it wanted to contest.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

Akali leaders Balwant Singh Bhunder (Rajya Sabha member) and Prem Singh Chandumajra (former MP) were negotiating with BJP’s Prakash Javadekar, Shyam Jaju and Tarun Chugh on seat-sharing for the past three days.

SAD leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, claimed at a press conference that his party had decided not to contest the Delhi assembly polls on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “SAD is of the firm stand that Muslims cannot be left out of CAA. We are also strongly against National Register of Citizens (NRC). SAD opposes NRC. We cannot accept that Indians will have to stand in queues to prove their identity. This country is for everyone,” said Sirsa.

Sources in BJP also said differences with Akalis over CAA have been a sore point.

Akalis supported CAA in Parliament and have justified its need, but want Muslims to be brought under its purview. BJP, however, has rejected the demand saying the bill was specifically aimed at fast-tracking citizenship for members of religious minorities from neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who fled to India before 2014 due to religious persecution.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said every party has its own point of view and he respects the stand taken by the Sikh party. “But our alliance with SAD is still on. It has always supported us in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and they also have a minister in the Union cabinet,” Tiwari said.

Initially, there were strong indications that SAD would contest the Delhi assembly polls on its own. After it became clear that talks were not moving forward, Bhunder said BJP wanted SAD leaders to contest the election on BJP symbol and the idea did not go down well with the party leadership. He said the party had asked its candidates to file their papers and would contest polls on its own.

However, after BJP announced its alliance with JD-U (three seats) and LJP (one seat) while skipping SAD, Sirsa convened a press conference and announced that the party had decided not to contest at all. The SAD election committee, comprising Rajya Sabha MPs Naresh Gujral and Bhunder along with Chandumajra had finalised names of four Akali candidates for Rajouri Garden, Hari Nagar, Shahdara and Kalkaji seats — the same seats that Akalis had contested in the 2015 Delhi assembly elections . Other seats in Delhi that have a sizeable Sikh population are Tilak Nagar, Janakpuri, Adarsh Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Vishwas Nagar, Timarpur and Jangpura.

BJP sources, however, said SAD’s decision to not contest the election at all would not augur well for the saffron party. “The Sikhs in Delhi have always been pro-establishment. The presence of SAD used to divide their votes in other constituencies which have Sikh votes. We saw the Sikhs gravitating towards AAP in the last two elections. With SAD not in the contest now, the Sikh vote may totally go in AAP’s favour,” said a senior BJP leader.

219,['21/01/2020'],Delhi: Order saying in-laws can’t evict woman stayed by SC,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a Delhi high court ruling that parents-in-law could not evict an estranged daughter-in-law who was fighting a domestic violence case against them and their son from their house without providing an alternative accommodation.

The high court on December 18 last year had set aside six eviction decrees of trial courts against similarly placed women and said the women had a right to residence till their matrimonial ties subsisted.

Appearing for an elderly parent-in-law, affected by the December 18 order, advocate Prabhjit Jauhar told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah that the HC exceeded the jurisdiction under the DV Act, which provided that a complaint could be made only against the husband and not against the in-laws. “Can the liability for alternative accommodation for estranged daughter-in-law be fastened on the in-laws’ self-acquired property?” he asked.

The bench stayed the HC order and issued notice to the respondent daughter-in-law. Jauhar asked, “Can it be said that merely by residing for some period in the self-acquired and absolute property of the in-laws, the daughter-in-law acquires a statutory right to reside in the same and can the in-laws be fastened with a liability to provide alternative residence to the daughter-in-law?”

BAREILLY: A three-member Special Task Force (STF) team has been constituted to probe the killing of an adult leopard in Budaun ’s Jarifpur Gadhiya village on January 12. It will be visiting the village soon. The STF is probing lapses by forest staff that led to villagers killing the big cat and how to handle such a situation in future.

The team has been asked to submit its report within one month.

The leopard was beaten to death by a group of villagers soon after it attacked and injured a teenager and another person in a span of two hours. After killing the leopard, one of the villagers cut off one paw of the big cat. Later, it was recovered by the forest department personnel.

The following day, an FIR was registered against eight named and 30-35 unidentified villagers under sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. The postmortem report of leopard is awaited.

Ramesh Pandey, one of the members of the STF and chief conservator of forests, told TOI, “STF will check if departmental action taken in the matter was appropriate. We are probing if there was laxity on the part of the staff. We will check the status of legal action taken in the matter and if it is moving in the right direction. Besides, we will suggest what action should be taken in such matters to prevent a repetition of such an incident in future.”

The other members of STF are forest conservator Javed Akhtar and veterinarian RK Singh of Kanpur zoo.

The killing of leopard in Budaun was the third incident to be reported in a week in west UP as one leopard each was killed in Bijnor on January 6 and Moradabad on January 8.

Lalit Verma, chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, said, “The measures suggested by STF in Budaun incident will be applicable elsewhere too, including Bijnor and Moradabad. Besides, we are in touch with senior police officers of Budaun and have identified locals who severed the leopard’s paw and were involved in its killing. The accused are absconding and efforts are on to nab them.”

222,['21/01/2020'],Vizagites pin development hopes on executive capital,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The state government on Monday introduced the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 in the Assembly to establish three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh. The Bill proposes to notify the area under Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority Area (VMRDA) as the executive capital, while the legislative capital will be located in Amaravati and judicial capital in Kurnool. The executive capital will house the secretariat, offices of the heads of departments and Raj Bhavan.

The government’s move to decentralise governance comes amidst dissatisfaction among certain sections of lack of development in north-coastal AP. Notifying Visakhapatnam as the executive capital is expected to propel growth in the region.

Senior bureaucrats from Amaravati, however, had made several visits to the Port City before the Bill was introduced in the Assembly, to enquire about vacant spaces. According to district officials, Millennium Towers and Startup Village in Rushikonda IT Hills are likely to house the chief minister’s office, the secretariat and other key offices.

Meanwhile, locals are hopeful that projects such as the proposed metro rail and the greenfield international airport at Bhogapuram will be speeded up once the executive capital shifts to the city. The legislation is also expected to attract investment to the region.

Welcoming the introduction of the Bill, VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao said the development authority will assume a crucial role in the growth of areas falling under its jurisdiction. “The VMRDA is currently preparing its master plan-2041 and perspective plan-2051. These plans will help identify major thrust areas, frame policy guidelines and vision for the growth and development of the region,” said Srinivasa Rao to TOI.

Ready infrastructure, provision of civic amenities and connectivity are expected to be major advantages in shifting the executive capital to the city. Further, once ongoing work on the six-way Anandapuram-Anakapalli highway is complete, National Highway (NH)-16 that passes through the city will be dedicated entirely to passenger traffic while heavy vehicles will be diverted.

KOLKATA: The family of a 20-year-old second-year college student, who met with a fatal accident on January 7, donated his organs on Monday, making it the second donation in the first month of the new year. The youth’s heart, lungs and two kidneys were transplanted to four patients.Sujoy Karmakar, the Kanchrapra College student was riding pillion on a friend’s motorcycle, headed for an examination centre in Haringhata, when the accident took place near Mohanpur. The rider, Papan Ghosh, died on the spot, while Karmakar suffered severe head injuries. He was first taken to JNM Hospital in Kalyani, from where he was shifted to SSKM Hospital’s trauma care centre (TCC) that was inaugurated last year. “Despite their efforts, doctors could not save Sujoy. The doctors told us Sujoy was brain death and counselled us to donate his organs,” said Sunjoy’s cousin, Dipannita Karmakar.Dipannita, who studied health sciences, was aware of organ donations but she was initially apprehensive whether Sujoy’s elder brother Sudeb and mother Maya Rani would consent to the donations or not. Sujoy’s father Sukar Rajan had passes away when the youth was a toddler. “But his brother and mother readily agreed that we should donate Sujoy’s organs to help others live. At this time of grief, it gives us solace that Sujoy will continue to live in others,” said Dipannita.The Kancharapara resident was declared brain dead at SSKM on Monday morning, once the family consented to the donation. ROTTO (Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant organisation) allocated the heart to Medical College and Hospital, the liver to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, while SSKM was allowed to retain the two kidneys.Last Monday, another road accident victim, Swapan Hazra, was declared brain dead and his heart, liver and kidneys were transplanted. The fact that this year’s first two donations have originated at SSKM Hospital, those involved in the movement hope to dispel the criticism that government hospitals recorded minimum brain-dead declarations.Like this year, even 2019 had started on a bright note with two donations in a gap of four days in January, but the year ended with 11 donations only. The figure fell short of four donations than that in 2018. “The SSKM’s trauma care centre could be a great source for organs as the centre deals with accident victims with head injuries. We hope the unit would help increase organ donations,” said a source in the hospital.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73463893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-414721,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-organ-donation-in-years-first-3-weeks-boosts-2020-drive/articleshow/73451801.cms

226,['21/01/2020'],Liquor shop manager robbed of Rs 2.5 L by two bike-borne men,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Bhopal: A 62-year-old liquor shop manager was allegedly looted of Rs 2.5 lakh, the store's daily collection, on Sunday night by two bike-borne men. The incident occurred near Banskheri Square in the posh Arera Colony of Habibganj, when Damodar Soni was returning home. According to Soni, the two accused hit his scooter from the rear. When Soni fell on the road and sustained injuries, the accused robbed his bag of cash and documents and fled the spot.

Habibganj police -- acting on the victim’s complaint -- registered a case of looting against the unidentified accused and started investigations.

SHO, Habibganj, SP Saxena, said that Soni, a resident of Indra Vihar Colony in Koh-e-Fiza, told police that he has been working at the liquor shop for the past 30-35 years. At present, he is the manager at a liquor shop at Manisha Market in Shahpura.

Soni told police that on Sunday night, the shop was closed at 11.30 pm. After counting the cash, he kept it in a bag and left for the company office, located at Bittan Market, on his scooter to deposit it. The bag was kept on the front platform of the scooter.

Soni further told police that around 11.45 pm, when he reached in front of SBI ATM in E5-Arera Colony near Banskheri Square, an unidentified vehicle hit his scooter from the back. The collision was so intense that Soni lost control and fell on the road with his vehicle. He sustained injuries in both his legs and shoulder. Before he could understand anything, an unidentified man allegedly picked up the bag carrying cash Rs 2.5 lakh, his bank passbook, ID documents and hearing aid. The accused ran towards the other lane of the road, where his accomplice was waiting for him on a bike. Both the accused then fled towards Manisha Market.

Soni said he raised an alarm, hearing which the security guard deployed at SBI ATM rushed out to help and informed the police.

However, police smell a rat in the loot story. CSP Bhupinder Singh said that usually cash from liquor shops is collected at night and is sent to the company office in a car. However, for the past three days, Soni was going alone to deposit the money. If cash is sent by a two-wheeler, it is ensured that two or three people escort the cash till the company office. These rules were not followed in Sunday's incident. Also, when a shop employee asked Soni to take him along, the senior citizen reportedly refused. Soni’s injuries were also superficial, which raises doubts, considering his age.

Singh said that police are investigating the case from all angles, including the involvement of insiders.

Later on Monday evening, police released CCTV grabs of two suspects, who were seen outside the liquor shop counter. DIG Irshad Wali announced a reward of Rs 20000 each on any information leading to the arrest of the accused.

Inspector Surendra Singh, in charge of the anti-corruption team, Bareilly, said, “We caught lekhpal Ramchandra while accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000 from Rampal Singh, a farmer hailing from Nakatpur village under Nawabganj tehsil.”

“Rampal had lodged a complaint that the lekhpal was threatening him with preparing a wrong report of his farm to extort money from him. We detained the lekhpal and handed him over to local police after lodging an FIR against him. He will be sent to the district jail,” said the inspector.

In his complaint, Rampal had stated that after he lodged a case in the court of the sub-divisional magistrate, Nawabganj, stating that the land registered to his wife’s name was lesser than her actual possession, the SDM sought a report from the lekhpal. The lekhpal, however, demanded a bribe for measuring the farm and also threatened him to make a fake report of the farm if he failed to pay money, alleged Rampal.

The next date of hearing at the SDM court is February 5.

N Uttam Kumar Reddy

HYDERABAD: State Congress chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy signed off the campaign with an emotional appeal to the voters to signal the beginning of an end to what he called an “aristocratic and arrogant” TRS government. Addressing roadshows in Neredcherla, Huzurnagar and Kodad municipalities on Monday, he said TRS was distributing liquor and cash to voters.

The TPCC President strongly condemned KCR for supporting the BJP Government at the Centre on the NRC and NPR issue by not speaking against them. Stating that not a single Muslim should vote for TRS in municipal elections, he said while Chief Ministers of many states have openly opposed CAA and announced that they would not implement NPR in their States, KCR has been maintaining silence on the issue. Despite repeated demands by the Congress for a special Assembly session to reject CAA, NRC and NPR, he said that the Chief Minister did not respond. He said the people of Telangana, especially Muslims could force KCR to pass a resolution against CAA in Telangana Assembly by not voting for TRS in municipal polls .

230,['21/01/2020'],Heritage activists rediscover remnants of old Fort Burj,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Heritage activists in Visakhapatnam recently took a walk up the old Black Hill to check out what remains of the Old Visakhapatnam Fort Burj (Fort Tower), which was once the northern frontier of the old fortified town.

According to the activists, much of the old Fort Burj, situated on the hillock, known as Black Hill was converted into a colony back in the 1930s and since then, much of the fort tower has vanished due to rapid urbanisation.

One of the activists, who took went up the hill in the old town, Edward Paul said, “That was once the highest point of the fort. The layout of the fort was very simple but strongly defensive. There were trenches, one towards the coast and the other towards, the marsh land.”

“The fort by itself was situated in a naturally defensive position, with the marsh lands towards the west, the sea towards the east and the Meghadrigedda Estuary towards the south (now the inner harbour),” Paul added.

He further said, “Even today the colony that is situated around the old Burj is known as Burjpeta, sadly with the exception of a few stone and brick-structures, there are very few remnants of the actual tower left.”

Paul added that most of the old European fortifications were built in places where the landscape offered natural protection and added that the Visakhapatnam Fort was no exception.

Heritage activists feel that Fort Burj could well serve as an anchor to re-discover the extent of the old fort and discover more about the old fortified city, because of which efforts must be made to preserve whatever is left of the old tower.

The response was overwhelming on Monday, with some 400 families turning up at the fair.

BAREILLY: Moradabad police have adopted a special strategy to wean people way from illegal activities by offering them an alternative employment. Police have organized a two-day employment fair for families involved in manufacturing illicit liquor in the city. The response was overwhelming on Monday, with some 400 families turning up at the fair.

Police managed to convince several NGOs, Vyapaar Mandal members and exporters among others to offer jobs to these families who have been struggling to make ends meet.

Last year, police shut down several illicit liquor manufacturing units operating in the residential areas of Civil Lines . As a result, several families were left with no alternative means of livelihood.

Appreciating the police’s efforts to give them an opportunity to work, Barkha, a job applicant at the fair, said, “We had lost all hope after the work (illicit liquor) was shut down. My husband and I are uneducated. My husband was forced to take up the liquor work as we had no other options. But we never wanted our children to lead a similar life. We wanted to send them to school and get an education but had no resources. Now, we will be able to fulfill our wish.”

Rekha, another applicant, said, “Who doesn’t want to work at a respectable place and do good work? We are very happy to be given a chance to be employed and associated with reputed organizations.”

Speaking with TOI, SSP Amit Pathak said, “The move aims at providing job opportunities to people and create employment for the affected families. Since most of them are poor and uneducated, they took up illegal work. But after the crackdown on liquor units, they faced more hardships.”

SSP added, “Providing them job opportunities will also curb chances of their getting involved in other criminal activities.”

Amit Anand, SP (city), said, “Around 400 families turned up in two days and applied for jobs. The applicants’ verification will be conducted and their criminal record will be checked. Thereafter, suitable jobs will be provided to them by the respective organizations. The jobs will be finalized probably by month-end.”

Vijayawada: In a major shock to Pawan Kalyan, Jana Sena ’s only legislator from Razole, Rapaka Varaprasad Rao, voted in favour of Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation & Inclusive Development of All Region Bill 2020 and Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) Repeal Bill 2020, which were tabled in the assembly on Monday.

This comes in the wake of Kalyan writing an open letter to Varaprasad Rao on Monday morning requesting him to vote against the bills as per the stand of the party.

But Varaprasad Rao seemed to have decided to not toe the party line. Addressing the assembly, the Razole MLA said that Jana Sena supports the decentralisation of administration across the state and praised chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy for proposing to develop all 13 districts equally.

He went on to say, “Our party chief is really happy with the concept of three capitals. But he is opposing the move as he is in the opposition. I strongly support the bill on behalf of my party in the assembly.” He appealed to the opposition parties to appreciate the good decisions made by the state government. “I have seen many migrant labourers from Srikakulam district fight for their survival. The decision to establish the executive capital in Visakhapatnam will change the fate of these migrant workers from north coastal Andhra Pradesh,” Varaprasad Rao said.

This however is not the first time that Varaprasad Rao has shown his appreciation for the YSRC chief to his party’s chagrin. He had earlier made statements praising Jaganmohan Reddy’s administration fuelling nervousness among his colleagues.

BAREILLY: A 22-year-old man died and three fell unconscious while cleaning the cane juice tank at a sugar mill in Isanagar area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday evening.

The deceased was identified as Mohammed Fayyaz, 22, a resident of Budaun .

The mill authorities had finished crushing sugarcane and were planning to down the shutters after tank cleaning when the accident occurred. Sources said that four labourers — Fayyaz, Suhail, Farukh and Tafseel — went inside the tank to clean it but fell unconscious due to poisonous gases. They were rescued by the other labourers who rushed them to a nearby hospital where Fayyaz succumbed later. The autopsy report also stated that he died due to suffocation. Sources said that the labourers were not given any safety gear before entering the tank.

A preliminary inquiry by Dhaurahra sub-divisional magistrate Sunandu Sudhakaran found the mill management guilty of negligence. He then submitted his report to district magistrate Shailendra Singh. Sudhakaran said, “I have submitted my preliminary investigation report and there is clear negligence on the part of the mill administration. The labourer had died due to sulphur dioxide leakage. I have recommended an FIR against the mill administration but the family has not lodged any complaint so far.”

Meanwhile, mill manager Sanjay Singh said that the victim died after slipping into the tank accidentally and not due to gas leakage.

“The erstwhile government and its ministers ignored the oath of secrecy. Heritage, owned by N Chandrababu Naidu’s family member purchased around 14.22 acres land at Kanteru village in July 2014.

Rajendranath also said that PAC chairman Payyavula Kesav had purchased land in Amaravati in the name of Payyavula Vikramasimha.

Charles Bruce, who set up Kolkata Scottish Heritage Trust in 2008 to salvage the cemetery

KOLKATA: A two-century-old place in the heart of the city for the dead that went to the seed decades ago has metamorphosed into a new space for the living .

The Scottish Cemetery , where 4,000 people had been laid to rest before being abandoned in the 1950s, has become a park in one of the most congested city neighbourhoods. Over 90% of those buried bear recognizably Scot names, such as Anderson, McGregor, Campbell and Ross, while the rest were Bengalis. “If you restore something that represents a large part of history, you have to make it relevant to people,” said Lord Charles Bruce , who has helped salvage the 6-acre cemetery that had turned into a rubbish dump and haven for anti-socials and drug-addicts.

Bruce, whose great-grandfather, Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin , and great-great-grand grandfather, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, served as Viceroys to India during the 19th Century, set up the Kolkata Scottish Heritage Trust in 2008 after reading an article by Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Gopal Krishna Gandhi, then governor of Bengal. “He wrote that if sites, like the Scottish Cemetery, disappear, an important part of Kolkata’s heritage would be gone. It was a call to action and I responded,” said Bruce, who lives in Broomhall House, a 300-year-old mansion in Fife, Scotland.

None of his relatives though is among the 3,000-odd Scots, many of them from Dundee, buried there. The rest are Indians, who had embraced Christianity. James Bruce, after whom Elgin Road is named, is the only Viceroy to be buried in India, in Dharamshala. Three of James’s cousins, who had died in Kolkata before the Scottish Cemetery was built, are buried in South Park Cemetery. Initiating a worldwide connect with the cemetery, Bruce garnered funds from descendants of people who had served in India. “Kolkata had a very distinct Scottish commercial presence with firms, like Burn Standard, James Finley, Andrew Yule, Inchcape, Mackinnon Mackenzie & Co and Bird & Co. Scots also established schools and colleges, like Scottish Church College and Hindu College, which was later renamed Presidency College,” Bruce said.

Nearly 3,500 tonne of debris was painstakingly excavated and removed by hand. Then began the restoration of tombs. Restoration architect Neeta Das, who is spearheading the work, said, “Unlike the restoration of a building, which can then be used or maintained by the owner, maintaining an abandoned cemetery after it has been restored is a challenge. An urban conservation project like this requires involvement of local community. In a neighbourhood such as this, open space is clearly a premium and the cemetery had a great opportunity to offer that to residents,” she said.

The trust now employs 20 people and spends around £25,000-£30,000 a year on the project. Locals have been trained as gardeners and stonemasons. Horticulturist Biswajit Ghosh has planted hundreds of trees and shrubs to turn the cemetery into a garden. “We now have 10 varieties of palms, eight varieties of fruit-bearing trees, 10 varieties of flowering trees and nearly 25 varieties of shrubs. In a corner, we have also set up a garden for vegetables and medicinal plants,” Ghosh said.

Social projects have been set up to bring the surrounding community into the cemetery. Of the 270 families around the edge of the cemetery, around 115 are participating in the project. Around 70 children study in the Santiniketan-style open-air Saturday school at the cemetery, where classes on drawing, dance, literacy, maths and personal development are offered.

“The outreach programmes have won over the illegal, displaced inhabitants. A necropolis has been converted into a space for the living where the past is also remembered,” said architect Mukul Agarwal, who along with other members of Calcutta Heritage Collective, spent an evening with Bruce to figure out how to raise funds and take up similar urban regeneration projects.

BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government is opposed to Niti Aayog's proposal for handover of district hospitals on public-private partnership (PPP) model, said MP health minister, Tulsi Silawat, here on Monday. In the midst of opposition to the proposal, Niti Ayog has cancelled its consultation meet in New Delhi that was scheduled for Tuesday, said sources.

“Public healthcare system is aimed at improving medical treatment for the poor. The aim of having government-run hospitals is to provide free and affordable medical care to all. If district hospitals are handed over on PPP-mode and run for profit, where will the poor go for medical treatment?"" said Silawat.

Chhattisgarh health minister, TS Singh, has also tweeted against the Niti Aayog proposal. Chhattisgarh is also a Congress-ruled state and health is a state subject.

The setback to the Union government’s policy making body comes as the Congress-led MP government is preparing to introduce ‘right to health Act' in the state. The Act would guarantee healthcare and also include penalty provisions for failure to deliver guaranteed services. Niti Aayog's proposal is called Public Private Partnership in medical education.

As per the proposal, a 60-year lease of district hospitals will be given to private operators. The scheme plans to link new and/or existing private medical colleges with ‘functional’ district hospitals through PPP. The need for such a move, Niti Aayog cites is based on dire shortage of qualified doctors and government's ‘limited resources and finances’. Stakeholders were requested to provide their written comments by February 25.

The PPP-mode operation of district hospitals has been a failure in Madhya Pradesh, said Amulya Nidhi of NGO, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. “In 2015, the state government proposed handover of 27 district hospitals. Handover of Alirajpur district hospital has been a failure. In fact, Niti Aayog report has skipped mentioning it as a success story,"" said Nidhi. He termed the Niti Aayog proposal as ‘selling’ of public healthcare to private players.

HYDERABAD: Three minor boys, who went missing on Sunday from Neela village in Nizamabad district , were found drowned in a trench in the village. The bodies of the three boys — Siddharth, Deepak and Mukheed —were fished out on Monday after they were spotted in a trench.

Police said the three boys, all aged between 7 and 8 years, left their house on Sunday to play with motorcycle tyres.

While they were playing with tyres, they accidentally fell into a trench. Though police were not sure how the three fell into the trench, they suspect that the boys might have fallen at once into the trench, which was very deep.

The bodies were recovered by district authorities after swimmers were pressed into action. The bodies of the boys were sent to the area hospital for post-mortem examination.

Installation of new track for Metro at Pimpri on Monday

PUNE: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited has approached the Railway Board, commissioner of Metro railway safety, and Research Designs and Standards Organization for essential clearances before rolling out the mass transport service in the city.

The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited ( MahaMetro ) said it had provided the drawings and other technical details to these three establishments of the Union government and the railway ministry earlier. It has now sought time slots for ground inspection of the tracks and rakes, and review of other technical specifications.

Recently, the Metro rakes were placed on the viaduct and preliminary trial runs were conducted using electric traction.

The MahaMetro is keen to complete the safety inspections on the PCMC-Dapodi route (Sant Tukaramnagar to Phugewadi stations) in the next two months. Similar inspections would be initiated on the Vanaz to Garware College route at a later stage, after the MahaMetro completes the viaduct work and rakes are placed on the tracks.

A senior official from the MahaMetro said contact had been established with all the three organizations in the past few days to obtain no objection certificates (NOC). “We have provided them with technical specifications, designs, project profiles and basic plans. These establishments are studying the plans and they will come back with suggestions, if any, based on the observations.”

The official said the inspection of tracks was generally done in two parts — review of the project documents and physical inspection. The MahaMetro is ready for both after taking all necessary measures for the safety of commuters at the Metro stations and on the tracks, the official added.

The MahaMetro said a plan was being chalked out for physical inspection by the railway organizations. “We are still working on the visits of authorities from the three organizations. We are hopeful to carry out the inspection next month or even earlier,” the official said.

The MahaMetro would be able to announce the date of starting the Metro service in the city after the inspection.

247,['21/01/2020'],Lord Balaji made party in PIL on park encroachment,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Monday made Lord Venkateswara a respondent in a public interest litigation (PIL) which questioned the construction of a temple in a park at Madhavapuri Hills in Ameenpur in Sangareddy district. It also warned the temple committee that if they fail to furnish necessary permissions “the temple is liable to be declared illegal” and may be demolished.

The committee will now appoint a lawyer for the deity during the next hearing on February 7. Stating that a temple is not above the law, the bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice K Lakshman directed petitioner Thakur Rajkumar Singh of Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust to make the temple deity a party to the case.

The temple committee had been insisting that the deity is a juristic person, who could sue and be sued. The committee’s counsel said that as a legal entity the deity should be heard before passing any order involving his safety.

Petitioner’s counsel C Narender told the bench the committee had occupied nearly two acres of park land and was raising a temple there in collusion with panchayat officials. To a query, the Ameenpur panchayat secretary’s counsel said they had issued a notice to the Madhavapuri Hills Residents’ Welfare Society asking the temple committee to stop construction. “We have also made a representation to the station house officer requesting him to control the likely law and order situation that might arise when the construction is stopped,” he said.

However, he could not answer any further queries as to what happened after that. “What were you doing when the construction did not stop? Why was the SHO inactive? Did you make any complaint to the higher-ups in the police department?” the bench posed, but did not get a reply.

The bench made it clear to the counsel representing the temple committee that if they fail to furnish permission and sanctioned plan granted by municipal authorities, “the construction was liable to be declared as illegal and hence deserved to be demolished”.

The judges also brushed aside the contention of the counsel that the sarpanch wrote a letter to the endowments department seeking approval for the temple. “A sarpanch is not the competent authority in such cases,” the CJ said. “A temple is not above the law and the Constitution,” he added.

The committee’s counsel said that the temple and the deity were juristic persons and since they were treated as minors, their rights need to be defended and protected. The bench then asked the petitioner to bring the deity on record. In other words, Lord Venkateswara would be added as one of the respondents like the state’s panchayat raj secretary, commissioners of HMDA and GHMC and the temple committee.

Pune airport

PUNE: Passengers boarding domestic flights from the city airport need to reach the facility at least three hours prior the departure time to ensure hassle-free security-checks and timely boarding because of enhanced security in the run-up to Republic Day .

“In view of the enhanced security measures, including additional checks enforced at the Pune airport, we request our passengers to report early (at least 2 hours in advance) and cooperate with the security agencies,” the Pune airport authorities posted on the Twitter handle on Monday afternoon.

The advisory coincided with the recovery of a bag with possible improvised explosive device components outside the terminal building of the Mangaluru airport.

Sources at the Pune airport said the flyers, to be on the safer side, should try and reach the facility much before the time mentioned in the advisory. “There will be the highest form of alert at the Pune airport in the run-up to Republic Day and because of what happened in Mangaluru. The entry of visitors into the terminal building has been stopped,” a source said.

“It will be safer for the flyers to reach the airport at least three hours before the departure time of their respective flights to avoid any hassles,” the source said.

The Pune airport has not used its Twitter handle or any other source to mention about enhanced security measures during events such as Republic Day or Independence Day in recent years. Pune airport authorities said they were coordinating with the airlines for the security arrangements.

An airport official said there might be long queues during the check-ins and security checks because of the enhanced arrangements. “Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel will randomly check passengers and their baggage at any given point in time. The body scanning machine will be used more frequently. The machine is currently being used at random and there been no complaints or objections from the passengers so far,” the official said.

“The area in front of the airport’s terminal building has been made free of any public transport movement. The CISF and the dog squad are ensuring a strict vigil. Airline representatives have been briefed to be on alert when it comes to baggage scanning,” the official said.

The airport witnesses a large number of arrivals and departures towards the evening till the early morning hours. The sources said the airport authorities were coordinating with the police to ensure random checking of the vehicles reaching the parking zone.

“There have not been any case of passengers missing their flights because of the enhanced security measures. But early arrival at the airport will mean hassle-free security check and check-ins,” the official said.

Trichy: To prevent adolescent children from falling victim to sexual harassments, police clubs will be formed in schools.

Police clubs were formed in colleges, which were effective in sensitizing teenage students to keep themselves safe in the virtual world. The need however is felt more in schools, said Trichy range deputy inspector general of police V Balakrishnan.

He said school students will be added as ambassadors to fight crimes against children. The primary objective was to sensitize these children on the protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012. Besides this, they will be elaborately explained about cybercrimes and how to prevent themselves from cybercrimes.

They will also be taught on some of the self-defence techniques to an extent that they may be able to protect themselves in case of any eventuality. The whole idea of introducing police club in schools was based on a study, which included interviews with victims of Pocso cases over the last one decade, said Balakrishnan. In most under-age marriages or elopement cases, the attraction seems to be coming as early as in the age of 13-14. We then decided that it would be appropriate to start this in colleges and schools, he said.

In the first stage, Trichy, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur and Pudukottai districts will have five schools selected each in the first stage. Each school will have a police club with 30 students each.

Jaganmohan Reddy

VIJAYAWADA: Replying to the debate on the bill to repeal the APCRDA Act in the assembly on Monday, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy said that his government was committed to provide basic infrastructure to people, distribute development to every part of the 13 districts, instead of spending big on a dream city.

He said addressing people’s pressing issues are far more important to his government rather than spending Rs 1 lakh crore in the 8-km radius of Amaravati.

He cited the recommendations of Sri Krishna Committee, Sivaramakrishnan Committee besides the Sri Bagh Pact, where decentralization of administration and development were recommended in his address.

“People in Rayalaseema and Uttarandhra feel neglected. There is no drinking water. They need water for agriculture and we need irrigation projects. We have to be judicious in spending whatever money we have,” the CM said.

“We are a new state, started our journey with revenue deficit. Naidu planned a big city with empty coffers much against the advice of Sri Krishna Committee and Sivaramakrishnan committee,” the chief minister said.

He discounted the claims of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu that Amaravati is a self-finance capital and wondered how would the government mobilise the money to fund the dream city. “As of now, we need Rs 1.09 lakh crore to provide infrastructure in Amaravati. Naidu had spent Rs 5,674 crore during his period and at that rate, the city would take at least 100 years to complete and the investment would run into several crores of rupees,” the CM said.

He emphasized the need for spending public money without putting burden on the people. He said the state’s development would be possible if infrastructure is provided in every part of the state rather than building a new city.

“The state would require Rs 45,000 crore to provide drinking water to people in the entire state. Shall we spend this money and give drinking water to the people or use it for infrastructure in Amaravati,” he asked.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD : A 28 year old youth was injured in a leopard attack at village Pimpalgaon Siddhnath, 3km ahead of Junnar, on Sunday morning, prompting the forest department to install a cage in the area.

Dashrath Bodke, a forest guard said, “Ganesh Khandagale had gone to water the crop in his field near Kukadi river in Vitthalwadi area when a leopard hiding on the higher ground pounced on him.”

Bodke said luckily the paw of the leopard got entangled in Ganesh’s jacket. “The leopard, however, dragged the youth for five feet, during which Ganesh hit the leopard with a bunch of keys. Resultantly, the leopard left him and ran away into the nearby fields,” he said.

He said Ganesh’s relatives rushed him to a private hospital in Junnar for treatment. “We suspect the animal to be a female leopard with her cubs nearby. She may have attacked the youth to protect the cubs,” Bodke added.

When contacted, Ganesh said after watering the crops, he was walking towards his two-wheeler when suddenly a leopard ran towards him from a distance of 100 feet. “Thankfully, I have suffered only some scratches on my stomach,” he said.

BAREILLY: Reprimanded by his mother for not studying properly, a 12-year-old boy allegedly hanged himself in Mirzapur block of Shahjahanpur district on Sunday. He had gone missing on Sunday and his body was later found hanging in a field. This is the third case of suicide by a minor in the district since November 2019.

On January 3, a 14-year old schoolboy had committed suicide after his mother had refused to come back home following a tiff with his father. His father was an alcoholic and used to often beat his mother. Before that, a 13-year-old schoolboy had committed suicide due to unknown reasons in Mirzapur in November.

Shobhit Mishra, a resident of Bahariya village, used to study in class VI. Not keen to continue with his studies, he used to often bunk his school. On Sunday evening, Shobhit was allegedly scolded by his mother, following which, he walked out of the house. A few hours later, when he didn’t return home, his father started looking for him but couldn’t find him.

At 10.30 pm, Shobhit was found hanging with a rope from a mango tree on their farm.

According to his parents, Shobhit used to spend hours sitting under his favourite mango tree whenever he was upset.

Mirzapur station house officer Dilip Yadav told TOI, “Prima facie, it is a case of suicide as there were no injuries on the body. We have sent the body for autopsy to ensure that there is no foul play. We have recorded the statement of family and neighbours and it was evident that the boy was scolded by his parents. We are trying to check if there is any other reason behind the incident.”

258,['21/01/2020'],Amaravati had potential to be country’s best city: N Chandrababu Naidu,"This story is from January 21, 2020

N Chandrababu Naidu

VIJAYAWADA: Former chief minister and leader of opposition N Chandrababu Naidu appealed to chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy not to shift the state capital from Amaravati.

He urged the government to make use of the existing facilities and infrastructure in Amaravati and develop other cities and regions.

Naidu spoke in the House after the bill for repealing APCRDA Act was moved on Monday and said Amaravati is the dream capital of people of Andhra Pradesh. He said the city has enough land bank for the government and thus the city would be treated as self-finance city. He cited the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the time of laying the foundation stone for the city, who visualized Amaravati as one of the 14 best cities of the nation.

The TDP chief said that he had developed Visakhapatnam as financial capital of the state during the last five years. He brushed aside allegations on suitability of the soil for construction and the claims on multi-crop agriculture land. He said that the National Green Tribunal too had admitted that Amaravati was not a flood-prone area and not a multi-crop zone.

He cited that the Sivaramakrishanan Committee had favoured Vijayawada-Guntur as the most suitable place for the capital in terms of connectivity and infrastructure. He said the Sivaramakrishnan Committee had one objection on shortage of land for Vijayawada. Naidu added that his government had acquired 33,000 acres from farmers.

“With 33,000 acres at the disposal of the government and with the positive points given by the Sivaramakrishnan committee, Amaravati is the most suitable place for the capital,” Naidu said.

He also brushed aside allegations about the location of the capital and said Delhi had been the capital for the undivided India which included Pakistan and Bangladesh. Similarly, Chennai had been the capital of combined Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and thus the cities were fixed as capitals in centrally-located place. Amaravati, too, was thus fixed as the capital for the residuary state after the division.

Naidu reminded Jaganmohan Reddy that the late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy continued some of the development initiatives of his government in the undivided state and requested the chief minister to continue Amaravati as the capital. “There is enough space for assembly, Secretariat and the high court. There is no need for the government to spend money, if there is no money. Run the show from the existing facilities and go for new city or additional infrastructure when there is money,” Naidu told the chief minister.

TimesView Allowing pedestrians to use facilities like elevators and escalators is a welcome initiative, especially since many Metro stations are located near roads with high-traffic density, often with dividers and few crossing locations. Given that most of the foot overbridges built by BBMP are not of much use — either because of their location or the manner of their construction — this seems to be a sensible alternative with additional footfall benefits for BMRCL.

BENGALURU: In order to provide safe passage to pedestrians near Metro stations — who often put their lives at risk by crossing busy roads — Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited is planning to allow non-Metro commuters to use its facilities for free.This means the general public can also use the stairs, escalators and elevators at Metro stations to go from one point to another during operational hours. Structural modifications to make this a reality are in the pipeline.“The goal is to provide road crossover connectivity to non-Metro users through unpaid areas at all existing Phase 1 Metro stations,” said BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth.“Phase 2 station layout is being done to provide such connectivity from the beginning itself. Also, wherever there’s a Metro station on one side of the road (for example Hosur Road), a foot overbridge will be constructed by BMRCL,” he added.Allowing non-Metro users will also help increase footfall at stations, which will enable BMRCL to tap non-fare revenue (from shops etc).“Several stations require changes in location of entry/exit fare gates and security check. Some need civil work too. MG Road Metro station doesn’t have such a facility. Similarly, even Nagasandra and Dasarahalli don’t have FOB connectivity to other side of the road. It will take six to 10 months to set up the facilities,” said Seth.BMRCL had earlier proposed an FOB across MG Road from Navrathan Jewellers side to the boulevard which houses Rangoli Metro Art Centre. In 2018, Hyderabad Metro Rail Corporation allowed pedestrians to use some stations. “It’s a good idea. BBMP is unnecessarily building FOBs in core city areas, even in places where the facility is not needed, just to shore up ad revenues,” said Aiswaraya Kumar, a passenger on MG Road.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73465200,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-541850,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pedestrian-safety-soon-non-metro-users-can-access-facilities-at-stations/articleshow/73450996.cms

262,['21/01/2020'],Leaving Congress biggest blunder on my part: DS,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Hyderabad: Senior politician and TRS Rajya Sabha MP Dharmapuri Srinivas , popularly known as DS, said on Monday that leaving Congress was the biggest blunder of his 40-year long political career.

The 71-year-old three-time MLA and former minister quit Congress on July 2, 2015, a year after Telangana was granted statehood by the then UPA government at the Centre in June 2014.

Days later, Srinivas joined TRS to realise the goal of what he termed a “bangaru (golden) Telangana.” However, his honeymoon with the ruling TRS did not last long. In the last couple of years, his relationship with TRS leadership strained further as he developed differences especially with former Nizamabad MP and chief minister’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha. His younger son Dharmapuri Arvind is a BJP leader and represents Nizamabad in the Lok Sabha after defeating Kavitha in the 2019 elections.

Srinivas said he resigned from Congress owing to differences he had with the then Congress incharge of Telangana affairs Digvijaya Singh who, he said, had insulted him. Srinivas had served as the state Congress president twice and also as a minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh. He was the president of Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee when the party assumed power under the leadership of late YS Rajasekhara Reddy in 2004.

Ahead of the municipal elections, Srinivas dared the TRS leadership to take action against him. Speaking to newsmen in Nizamabad, he also took an indirect dig at chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao saying “father, son and daughter have become golden” in the name of achieving a golden Telangana.

Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government , in a letter to the Union government, has refused to purchase imported onions for sale in the state. The government of India had earlier asked the state to purchase imported onions so that increased onion prices could be stabilized.

While refusing to purchase imported onions, the state government has contended that Gujarat’s onion farmers will be adversely affected if imported onions are sold in the state. Besides, the taste of imported onions falls short of the taste of locally grown onions, the state government letter says.

A senior state government official said that CM Vijay Rupani decided to write to the central government refusing to purchase imported onions after consultation with various stakeholders and seeking feedback of senior officials. “The CM has also already informed the Centre in writing that, Gujarat is one of the key onion producing states and our farmers are likely to be adversely impacted if we purchase imported onions. Moreover, people have not liked the taste of imported onions. Even if Gujarat purchases imported onions, there will be problem of demand. Moreover, the price of locally produced onions has come down,” the official said.

The Centre had written to all states, asking them to purchase imported onions and distribute these so that skyrocketing prices of onions could be brought down. However, the government received feedback from consumers that the imported onions did not taste as good as the locally produced varieties.

Prices of onions have stabilized at around Rs 60 per kg after selling for over Rs 100 per kg recently.

The central government, in December last year, approved import of 36,090 metric tonnes of onions amid the supply crunch. These onions were mainly imported from Turkey and Egypt. The country had last imported 1,987 tonnes of onion in 2015-16.

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court , on Monday, posted the hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the imposition of Section 144 in the capital region and police action on women protesters to Wednesday.

The bench headed by Chief Justice JK Maheswari and Justice AV Seshasai told the petitioners and respondents that the court will take up the matter on Wednesday and hear it along with other petitions connected with capital matters.

Advocate general S Sriram sought time to file a detailed counter on the action initiated against police officials for allegedly manhandling women. The advocate general told the court that a few incident took place in the process of maintaining law and order. The bench directed the advocate general to file a report on all such incidents that took place in the capital region.

On the other hand, the high court extended the time limit for farmers to submit grievances to the AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) by two more days.

The petitioners argued that the notices given to farmers did not mention anything other than to submit grievances. They said that the notices are incomplete and should specifically mention the matters on which the farmers have to give their opinion or air their grievances.

The bench observed that it will set aside the notices or any consequential action if the notices are found to be faulty and incomplete and posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday.

Hridya S Nair

BENGALURU: For Bengaluru girl Hridya S Nair , January 20, 2020, will always be special. The 16-year-old got a chance to moderate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Pariksha pe Charcha event at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi.

Hridya, a class 11 student of Kendriya Vidyalaya , DRDO and one of the three student-moderators at the third edition of the event where 2,000 students participated, said the thought of sharing the stage with the PM had made her extremely nervous.

“The pressure was immense. But once I started speaking, I looked at PM Modi, who was also looking at me and listening very carefully. At that moment, I felt like I was talking to a friend. He indirectly helped me do better and shed my nervousness, because when someone listens to you, you just want to do better,” Hridya gleamed.

She asked 10 of the 20 questions students from across the country posed to the PM.

“I was left spellbound at the end of the event when Modi extended his hand towards me and said ‘aayiye (please come).’ I was supposed to thank him in Hindi, but forgot what I had to say as I was completely star-struck by his warm and friendly gesture,” she said.

Hridya, who stood first at the national-level elocution competition held by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) as part of its Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat event in October 2019, underwent intense training (from 8am to 6pm)s every day from January 15 to 19.

“We were also trained to be ready for anything out of the script,” she said, adding that they had to start by introducing the students and inviting them to ask questions.

“Next step was summarising their question for Modi and after he answered it, we had to thank him and summarise his answer,” Hridya said, explaining that while the PM answered the questions, they were backstage taking notes with their teachers.

Hridya’s aim is to join Indian Foreign Service .

Her English teacher at KV DRDO and mentor Jinu Pavithran told TOI Hridya topped the school in class 10 and scored 98%. Her father CN Satheesh works at Aeronautical Development Agency and mother Smitha Satheesh is a pharmacist. She is thankful to her parents for allowing her to skip continuous assessment exam that was scheduled for Monday. “My five-year-old sister, Dheera, had asked me to tell the PM that she is his big fan. But I couldn’t,” said Hridya.

KV DRDO teacher Shivani Ranjan said excitement soared on campus, where the event was screened live. “Nearly 1,050 students watched their schoolmate without blinking,” she said.

Thirty-two students from Karnataka attended the event in New Delhi.

KOLKATA: Multiple fatal truck accidents reported across the city since the beginning of the New Year have led the police to brainstorm for solutions.A 63-year-old man was run over by a truck near Garia in the wee hours of Monday when he was on the way to his office in Raniganj. This is the 14th major accident in the city in a span of 20 days this year. The victim, Rajat Dutta Roy, a resident of Garia’s Purbapara, was waiting for his daughter at a bus stop, according to the police.Most accidents involving trucks are taking place after the “traffic hours” — 10pm when traffic cops are discharged from duty for the day. However, cops are thinking whether the abrupt change in routes with the closure of several bridges and more focus on bikes and buses are triggering a spurt in truck accidents in the city. The morning fog also makes it difficult for those at the wheels of trucks, said the police. “The local police officers can guide the truck drivers and take action against them if they resort to reckless driving,” said a Lalbazar officer.Most accidents were reported from three zones like Hastings, Bypass connectors and Canal Road. Unlike this year, the number of truck accidents came down to 313 in 2019 from 373 in 2018.“The closure of several bridges, especially Tallah Bridge and Kidderpore Bridge has disturbed the movement of trucks. We need to fix certain specific routes to ensure that trucks can use the Strand Road or EM Bypass at night from the north. They should not take Beniapukur and Entally where three accidents were reported this month,” said the police.Ever since the Majerhat Bridge collapse and closure of Tallah Bridge, it is not possible for cops to check all intersections, though night checks have been strengthened. “With managing the trucks crossing DH Road, Karunamoyee Bridge, RG Kar Road and Chitpore Lock Gate, most of our night forces are getting stuck there,” added the police.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73464585,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-553047,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/spurt-in-truck-accidents-as-closed-routes-take-toll/articleshow/73452095.cms

HYDERABAD: A 70-year-old beggar was burnt to death while sleeping inside an abandoned car in Vikarabad ’s Tandur on Sunday night. Police suspect that a smouldering cigarette-end inside the car may have caused the fire.

The deceased, Veeranna, is said to have consumed alcohol inside the car before the incident. “Veeranna generally keeps his cotton bed on top of the car, whenever he sleeps inside it...After he consumed alcohol, his cigarette might had have fallen on the bed which spread (the fire) across the car. Later, the fire spread to a nearby tent which too was burnt,’’ Vikarabad police said.

Police are also investigating the possibility of the fire having started from the tent. “On Sunday, there was a jatara (festival) at a local temple. Some persons had set up a tent and cooked food using sticks close to the abandoned car. They may have left without putting out the fire completely which then spread from the tent to the care,” police said.

The persons who had arranged the tent told police that the fire had been put out before they left.

‘Segregation has to start at airport’

BENGALURU: With the deadly novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection affecting more than 200 people and claiming three lives in China, doctors in Bengaluru are as concerned as their counterparts elsewhere in the world.While medical professionals feel growing passenger traffic between Bengaluru and China is enough cause for worry, authorities at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday sounded the first alert as a precautionary step.“Bengaluru airport has no direct flight to the affected cities in China. However, BIAL has taken precautionary measures to manage novel coronavirus cases. Based on the guidelines received from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, BIAL has set up a helpdesk at international arrivals. Thermal screening of passengers from Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur started on Monday,” said a BIAL spokesperson. Thermal imaging scanners used at airports can potentially detect if a person has fever.Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe ones like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). However, nCoV is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, according to the World Health Organisation.Meanwhile, the state health and family welfare department has deputed health assistants from Bengaluru Rural district to Airport Health Organisation, KIA, for passive surveillance of self-reporting passengers seeking medical assistance.The department on Friday held an orientation programme for district surveillance officers on nCoV infections. Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Health Sciences in Bengaluru and Wenlock Hospital in Mangaluru have been identified for treatment of any suspected case.“Till now, no suspected cases have been reported in Karnataka or India. However, if symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness are experienced during or after travel, passengers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with healthcare providers,” said Dr Prakash Kumar, joint director, communicable diseases, health and family welfare department.Novel coronavirus can be mistaken for common cold, cough and respiratory infections, given the similar symptoms.nCoV is a new variant of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulty.According to Dr Satyanarayana Mysore, HoD, consultant pulmonology, respiratory and sleep medicine, Manipal Hospitals, coronavirus belongs to the same family as the SARS virus. “Though there’s no immediate threat in Bengaluru, there are concerns as Wuhan, the worst affected city in China, is a transit hub. Asking for the travel history of a suspected person is essential. But we must also note that infection-control mechanism is strong worldwide, especially as countries have experience in handling SARS. Patient segregation has to begin at the airport itself,” he said.Dr Mysore added that respiratory infections see a spike from October to January, suggesting those with asthma, upper respiratory infections and underlying lung conditions get vaccinated for influenza. However, the influenza vaccine doesn’t provide blanket coverage and only shields one from influenza virus.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73518428,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59482,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/china-virus-scare-screening-of-flyers-begins-at-kia/articleshow/73449252.cms

At approximately 1215hours on January 13, 2020, the school bus while returning from the Army Public School crossed the Sopan Baug red light and was gradually traversing through the traffic to take a right turn towards general Parade Ground Road. The scooterist was on the Kacha track and tried to climb up the road, which is 3 to 4 inches high, and lost balance. He fell onto the left and the pillion rider fell to his right. The pillion rider was not wearing helmet and sustained head injury owing to impact of falling down. The co-driver of the school bus saw the pillion rider falling on the ground and halted the vehicle. He got down and assisted both the injured, thereafter, he took help of a passerby to get hold of an auto and dispatched them to the nearest hospital. There was no involvement of the Army School bus in the reported incident. In fact, the co-driver as a good Samaritan helped the injured.

TOI correspondent replies: The report was based on the FIR in which the complainant stated that “a green-coloured military school bus” dashed his moped from the rear, resulting in injuries to him and death of his wife, riding pillion. The complainant stated in the FIR that the co-driver of the bus got down from the heavy vehicle and there was a crowd of other vehicles following the accident. The complainant further stated in the FIR that “an autorickshaw driver then requested the co-driver of the bus to take both the victims to the hospital, but the co-driver got back into the bus, which drove away without lending any helping hand to the victims”. Later, the autorickshaw driver, with the help of some other people, shifted the complainant and his wife to a private hospital, the FIR stated.

“The transactions happened via my Axis Bank debit card in New York, while I was in Bengaluru,” Gupta said, regretting that the bank couldn’t detect the fraud.

Police issued a notice to the pub in Koramangala, seeking details about the machine they used to swipe Gupta’s card and details of the staff who handled the device. “This is a clear case of skimming. We are checking with other places where Gupta had used the card,” a police officer said.

Ahmedabad: An entire generation of Gujarati medium students know him for his poem ‘Unt kahe aa sabha ma...’ included in textbooks and those studying sociology by his Gyati Nibandh (an essay on caste) on evils of casteism written 17 years before Mahatma Gandhi’s birth. But Kavi Dalpatram (1820-1898) was not just a poet or social reformer.

His works as a pioneer of Gujarat Vernacular Society — later Gujarat Vidya Sabha — influenced the city with establishment of Ahmedabad’s first public library, first newspaper, first periodical, first school for girls and first literary society to name a few. Today his old residence is a prominent part of city’s heritage walk with a chowk dedicated to him with a statue at Lambeshwar ni Pol.

As the poet’s 200th birthday will be celebrated on Tuesday in a major event in the city, his descendants are planning a revival of his works. Kunal Kavi, great great grandson of the poet, said that they are marking the occasion by bringing the poet to the digital era.

“We are launching a website dedicated to his works along with accounts on prominent social networking sites. All his works will now be available online. The primary motive behind the move is to communicate that apart from a poet, his oeuvre was much larger,” he said.

Professor Ramji Savaliya, former director of BJ Institute of Learning & Research, said that unfortunately Dalpatram was seen with a specific lens by later era critics due to his views on British rule and religious leanings.

“One should remember that he talked about girl child education, remarriage of widows, condition of cottage industry in the face of machine era and social evils in the 19th century society and also worked tirelessly to promote Gujarati — his incident at the Gaekwad court is a legend now,” he said.

Creator of wordplay

Experts point at Dalpatram’s penchant for creating designs with words which could be read in non-linear fashion. In some of the examples found in ‘Dalpat Kavya’ collection, he has written the poem imagined as spokes of a wheel, serpent, bow and arrow and even as move of the knight in game of chess. Experts said that only a few such examples are seen in his contemporary Gujarati — the activity considered by him to be a ‘mental exercise.’

He also urged parents to not pressurise their wards during board exams and allow them to engage in extra-curricular activities.While interacting with PM Modi via video conferencing, Mayank asked, “People like Bill Gates, Thomas Edison, and even Mark Zuckerberg failed during early years of their life. Hence, a person cannot be judged on the basis of the marks that he/she gets in exams. I want to know that what is the amount of focus one should have to score good marks in exams?”Responding to the question, PM Modi said that “we must rise above exams.” “Today, the world has changed a lot. The opportunities have developed immensely. Marks are not everything anymore. Neither is any examination. These are just steps… an environment is created where students are told that marks precede everything. I urge parents to not tell their children that exams are everything,” the PM said.Interacting with students, the Prime Minister urged them to be confident of their own preparation and avoid stress as much as they can. He added that “not pursuing a co-curricular activity can turn a person into a robot.” He also stressed on the importance of time management for students. “Today, I am interacting with students who would play a key role in India’s development in 2047, when we mark hundred years of our country’s independence. I hope this generation takes it upon themselves to act on some of the fundamental duties enshrined in our Constitution.”He further said that students should make best possible use of technology but shouldn’t get distracted because of it. “Four family members sitting together but each one involved in his/her phone — this has become a common sight these days. Can we think of a technology-free hour? Perhaps, we can mark a space where no technology is permitted. This way, we won’t get distracted by technology,” the PM said.Notably, 11 students from various schools of Uttarakhand took part in the ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ programme with PM Modi in New Delhi. Meanwhile, live telecast of the programme was arranged in over 2,000 government and private schools across Uttarakhand. In several schools, teachers also interacted with students and answered their exam-related queries. In some schools, counsellors were arranged to answer the exam stress-related queries of students.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pariksha-pe-charcha-are-results-the-only-criteria-for-success-in-life-ukhand-boy-asks-pm/articleshow/73442037.cms

Newly appointed AICC General Secretary and State in-charge Deepak Babaria along with party's State President A... Read More

Bhopal: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday appointed a seven-member coordination committee for Madhya Pradesh to ensure ‘better coordination’ between party and the government. AICC general secretary Deepak Babaria, who is also in-charge of state affairs, has been appointed chairman of the committee.

The members are chief minister Kamal Nath, former CM Digvijaya Singh, AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia, former state Congress president Arun Yadav, minister for higher education Jeetu Patwari and former MP Meenakshi Natarajan.

State PCC office-bearers said that the appointment is not just for Madhya Pradesh, but other states where the Congress is in power, including Chhattisgarh, Puducherry and Rajasthan. “These leaders will be the bridge between the organization and the government. They will monitor manifesto promises and policy implementation, besides listening to the grievances of party workers,” a senior state Congress leader said.

Since the formation of government in December 2018, Congress workers have been repeatedly complaining that ministers do not meet them. In many internal party meetings, Deepak Babaria has warned ministers that they need to give time to grassroots workers and receive their calls. There have also been disagreements in the top leadership regarding the appointment of chairpersons for independent boards and corporations. Most of these appointments have not been made for lack of coordination between leaders.

In the state government, leaders have often expressed their grievances on Twitter and shot letters to Kamal Nath, instead of speaking directly to him on telephone.

SALEM: A 62-year-old man from Chennai was found murdered in Salem on Monday.

The victim, Balasubramaniam, from Kambar Street in East Tambaram, was working in a trust in Salem. Police are yet to narrow down on the suspects or arrive at the motive for the murder. “But we are interrogating various people. Right now we are questioning two men,’’ said a police officer.

According to police, Balasubramanian was running a small manufacturing unit in Salem 10 years ago. After incurring losses, his family moved to Tambaram. He returned to Salem a few days ago and started working in the trust as a manager. He was staying in a rented house at Sathapadi for the past 10 days.

On Monday morning, his body was found with strangulation marks on Kamaneri to Kovilur road. Villagers spotted the body and informed the village administrative officer Govindan, who lodged a complaint with the Mecheri police. His motorcycle was also found near the spot. Police said there were injuries on his face and body due to stabbing. The body was sent to the Salem government hospital for postmortem.

PUNE: Special judge Jayant Raje on Monday directed that a public notice be issued inviting objections and claims over the impending confirmation of attachment of 463 movable and immovable properties belonging to jailed developer DS Kulkarni, alias DSK, and his relatives in connection with the alleged multi-crore rupees economic fraud by the DSK group .

Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan said the total worth of these properties is over Rs1,500 crore. “The court will pass a common order after examining and hearing the objections and claims. Confirmation of attachment will pave the way for raising money via auction of all these properties and clearing dues payable to banks and depositors, among others.”

“Banks alone have loan recovery claims worth Rs1, 550 crore, while the depositors have a claim of Rs1,283 crore. Amount relating to debentures is Rs135 crore. Barring Kolhapur and Mumbai (where separate cases have been registered), the fraud probed by the Pune police has affected 35,000 investors, mostly from Pune,” Chavan said.

He said the recovery claims of banks will get a precedence over that of the depositors.

Activists, however, said the interest of poor investors should be protected first. “The law should be changed to safeguard the interest of poor investors,” RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said.

Another activist said, “An autorickshaw driver, one of the investors in DSK firms, ended his life two days ago. The authorities concerned must take appropriate steps to ensure protection of the investors.”

Last Friday, the Pune police’s economic offences wing (EOW) wrote to the district and session’s court and the revenue authorities for expediting the property attachment process after autorickshaw driver Tanaji Korake (61) committed suicide. Korake had left two suicide notes, one of which blamed DSK for his woes.

Assistant commissioner of police (EOW) Shivaji Pawar said, “After the court confirms the attachment, the local revenue officials (district collector is the competent authority under the MPID Act) will do the valuation and auction the properties.”

DSK’s proposal

DSK’s lawyer Dhiraj Ghadge said the developer had made an oral representation to the court seeking appointment of a new builder and an architect for completion of the stalled ‘Dream City’ project on Pune-Solapur Road, which can yield Rs10,000 crore. “The court has asked us to submit a formal written proposal by next date on February 3,” Ghadge said.

Brother moves bail plea

Makarand Sakharam Kulkarni, DSK’s brother and co-accused in the case, moved a bail application through his lawyer Rohan Nahar. The court directed the state to make a written submission on Makarand’s plea by January 24 . The court will hear on February 3 the matters related to the public notice.

NAGPUR: Four friends, who planned to take their families on a Dubai tour , were duped of Rs2.10 lakh by two tricksters on the pretext of offering them a cheap tour package between January 1 and October 29 last year.

Though the victims have named Ajay Rathod and Abhishek Fasin as the culprits, Tehsil police say they are yet to ascertain the identity of the accused.

According to police, Hitesh Rajkotiya, 37, was present at his garments shop in Gandhibagh on January 1 when his friend Bhavik Puranik visited him to discuss an advertisement by Trip Zolo Tours and Travels on Facebook offering an attractive Dubai tour package. Puranik filled up the details to get the quotation for the tour.

Later, he was contacted by one Ajay Rathod claiming to be from Trip Zolo. A few days later, Puranik received a mail claiming that a ‘six days, seven nights’ tour to Dubai will cost around Rs55,000 per person. On finding the deal cheap, Puranik along with Hitesh and two others decided to avail the offer.

As instructed, the four deposited Rs2.10 lakh in an account in the name of Abhishek Fasin as advance and received 14 tickets of a flight from Nagpur to Sharjah . However, later it turned out that the tickets had been cancelled.

On further enquiries it was revealed that the accused had ‘booked’ the tickets without paying money. A few airlines offer to block the tickets for a short period and the same get cancelled automatically if the fare is not paid within some hours.

When the four tried to contact Ajay, his mobile was switched off. After realizing that they have been duped, the four friends approached Tehsil police and lodged a complaint.

The police have tracked the travel agency to Haryana and have registered a case of fraud against the accused under sections of IPC and IT Act.

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh economic offences wing (EOW) has decided that samples of gutka and other raw materials that the food safety department had received following purity tests, would be sent for separate testing.

Incidentally, the EOW had recently raided a factory in Govindpura and seized samples of gutka and other raw materials. On Monday, the food safety department received reports of 40 samples sent for purity test, which included 12 samples of gutka. Out of the total 40, 15 have failed the test while remaining 25 cleared the Food Safety & Standards Act (FSSA) standards.

Among the 12 gutka samples, six samples of known gutka companies were found substandard while none of them were found unsafe for consumption.

The EOW, however, has decided to send samples of the gutka and raw materials for investigations to examine whether it contains hazardous substances, sources said.

“EOW has received some complaints about the samples so they want to verify at their own level,” said an officer in the local administration. Role of some top officials of the food department are also under scanner.

Meanwhile, sample of a brand of gutka, produced in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida, taken during a drive in MP were found to have magnesium carbonate content more than permissible limit, and has, therefore, been classified unsafe for consumption. Sample of betel leaves taken from New Market was declared ‘unsafe’ because it contained tobacco as well.

Besides, four milk samples taken from two establishment in the city were found substandard because they did not have the requisite fat content.

Producers/suppliers of all the samples found substandard or unsafe are being served notices under the provision of FSSA, said DK Verma, senior food safety officer based at Bhopal.

Meanwhile, mobile food lab, which is going to various localities in Bhopal to display how purity of edibles is checked can be checked at homes itself, on Monday went to Indrapuri, Anand Nagar, Gulmohar, Piplani and Bawadia Kalan areas and interacted with residents there. The sample brought by residents were put to test before them by the technicians accompanying the mobile lab and report were submitted on the spot. They were also given tips on how they can themselves check purity of goods by simple techniques. In all, 32 samples were tested in the drive against adulteration, now christened as ‘Shudh Ke Liye Yudh’.

Incidentally, it was the final day of mobile food lab on the roads of Bhopal. During past 10 days, while operating in different areas of Bhopal, the lab tested more than 300 samples brought by residents.

Tirupur: The delay in shifting the weekly cattle market at Thennampalayam to a convenient place in the city has frustrated farmers.

Despite promising to shift the cattle market to Koyilvazhi or other convenient place a few months ago, the city corporation is yet to take a concrete decision on it, a farmer alleged.

With cattle from across the district and neighbouring districts being brought to the Monday market, the need for a bigger space is imminent. “The cattle market could have been convenient during the early days but now the city has grown and become more congested. Moreover, the cattle market’s space was divided to accommodate daily vegetable market, fish market, and Ulavar Santhai. So, the farmers who bring the cattle were put into hardship,” said M Eesan, a farmer from Pollikalipalayam.

“The vehicles which bring the cattle should wait in long queues on Palladam Road and ABT Road for several hours to enter the market. The cattle struggle to stand under the sun,” Eesan said.

P Mahesh Kumar of Poomalur, another farmer, said, “There were works undertaken under the Smart City scheme in the market area, and it has further shrunk the space. The cattle market does not have basic amenities to provide drinking water to either cattle or farmers. There is lack of toilet facility too.”

Corporation commissioner K Sivakumar said, “We have written to the district administration to provide a land at Koyilvazhi two months ago. If the farmers wanted to shift them immediately, we will take action soon.”

KOLKATA: Traffic cops are consulting with the detective department to develop a standard operating procedure, by which all drink driving and rash driving cases lead to temporary suspension of licences.

The local traffic control room (TCR) and Lalbazar control room will also use modern technology to identify the buses breaking rules like overtaking and blocking bus channels. Local guards will be asked to take stringent actions against them. This move comes for the areas where traffic sergeants are not stationed.

On Monday, cops from 25 traffic guards and senior officers at Lalbazar discussed to find ways to curb fatal accidents, especially those involving buses. “Commissioner Anuj Sharma asked us to take steps to control accidents. We discussed all possible steps that can be taken,” said a police officer.

In addition, police have identified certain black spots at Shyambazar, BT Road, Ultadanga and several other stretches under the South guard, where introducing road furniture is a must to stop bus accidents. “This will include setting up bumble strips.

In several cases, roles of the bus conductor and the pedestrian are as questionable as that of the driver, said the police, adding that the black spots are among the city’s worst performing zones.

“Maximum accidents happen when motorists try to overtake the buses blocking or stopping in the middle of the road,” said a police officer. However, cops will urge Kolkata Municipal Corporation to block open spaces that will channelize pedestrian flow at the crossings.

Cops have cited certain examples to substantiate their point. There have been several accidents in the past on either side of Howrah Bridge’s approach road where the victims had tried to board a bus with luggage and fell down after losing balance.

At Maniktala, Bagmari and Ultadanga, pedestrians block roads to board buses and meet with accidents.

Pune: A 25-year-old woman pillion rider died and her husband sustained injuries after their motorcycle was hit by a Shivneri bus near Wakad bridge on Sunday afternoon.

The Hinjewadi police identified the deceased woman as Ashwini Tanaji Murudkar of Bhosari. Her husband Tanaji (28) has lodged an FIR against the bus driver with the Hinjewadi police.

“We have confiscated the vehicle and ascertained the identity of the driver who will soon be arrested,” A B Hingole, sub-inspector of the Hinjewadi police, said.

Hingole said the accident happened around 12.30pm on Sunday when both vehicles were travelling towards Chandni Chowk. When they reached the bridge over the river, in an attempt to overtake Murudkar’s motorcycle, the bus dashed it. “Due to the impact, Ashwini, who was riding pillion fell off the motorcycle and came under the wheels of the bus,” Hingole said.

The driver fled after the accident. “We have booked the driver under section 304 A (causing death due to negligence), 279 (rash driving), 337, 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code,” Hingole said.

Panaji: BJP and AAP have demanded immediate action against the general manager of South Western Railways for referring to MLA Alina Saldanha and the people of Cortalim as ‘Portuguese’.

Bringing the issue to the attention of the Union railways minister and the Prime Minister’s office, BJP spokesperson and former MP Narendra Sawaikar tweeted, “We are Indians firstly & lastly. @PMOIndia @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc@RailMinIndia”. He demanded an apology from the general manager.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Elvis Gomes also asked that the official be sacked and launched an attack on the official’s arrogance in insulting Goans by calling them non-Indians in the presence of BJP MLA Alina Saldanha.

The remarks by Ajay Singh directed at Alina are “audacious” and showed that the BJP MLA was found wanting in giving an adequate response. “I call upon Goans to boycott BJP which is engaged in spreading communal poison through mindless laws such as CAA,” said Pradeep Padgaonkar, AAP general secretary.

286,['21/01/2020'],Pune: IMD hints at second cold spell around Republic Day,"Minimum temperatures might be short-lived and replaced by another cold spell in Maharashtra

PUNE: Citizens planning to celebrate this year’s Republic Day outdoors may have to ensure multiple layers of warmers, as the city is expected to record the second and longest spell of cold conditions this season from January 25 to 26.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials on Monday said the current rise in minimum temperatures might be short-lived and replaced by another cold spell in Maharashtra , during which the minimum temperature could fall to around 8 degrees Celsius, or even less, in Pune. If this happens, the city could have one of its lowest night temperatures for the season so far. Till now, the lowest minimum temperature in Pune has been 8.2 degrees C.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD, Pune, told TOI that the cold conditions would peak across Maharashtra around January 26-27, when night temperatures in many locations could plunge below 10 degrees Celsius. “The upcoming cold spell in Maharashtra, including Pune, may also be the first for the state that would continue for a few days,” he said.After January 28, Kashyapi said, the northerly wind component over Maharashtra would partially reduce, but moderate cold flow would still continue till around January 29-30 in the lower atmospheric level at a 900m height from the mean sea level. “From January 26, we may expect cold wave conditions over isolated parts of Maharashtra for a couple of days. Chances of ground frost in one or two pockets can also not be ruled out during this period, especially for the northern parts of the state, including Pune district. The upcoming cold spell can also be stronger than the last one experienced on January 17-18,” he said.“Cold northerly winds would begin penetrating the state around January 24 noon or evening onwards. One of the reasons for the resettling of northerly winds in the state would be the shifting of the anticyclone, which currently lies over south of Orissa, adjacent Chattisgarh, and eastern parts of Vidarbha. This anticyclone will begin moving southwards from January 24-25 and slowly disappear. It is the location of the anticyclone that has been blocking the northerly winds from entering the state from time to time. Once it moves away, the path of northerly winds to enter Maharashtra could clear up,” Kashyapi said.Citizens may have to take extra precautions to keep the cold at bay if they are planning to go out to celebrate Republic Day. Harshad Limaye, a biker participating in a biking event ‘Republic Day Ride 2020’ on January 26 morning, said, “Apart from the riding jackets, helmets and mufflers we wear during the biking events in winter, we would wear an extra pair of clothes to keep the chill at bay.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73463212,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-626386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/imd-hints-at-second-cold-spell-around-r-day/articleshow/73452182.cms

Tirupur: A Class XII girl from the city, who was part of the state kabaddi team that won the silver medal in Khelo India Games, says she wants to represent India in international competitions and bring glory to the country.

G Yalini of Jaivabai Corporation Girls’ Higher Secondary School and her team were runnerup in the under-17 category in Khelo India Games 2020 held in Guwahati.

The 16-year-old girl was living with her grandmother after her parents got divorced when she was 2. “My grandma used to work in a knitwear unit and raised me with her meagre income. After she stopped working, I moved to a hostel. The Tirupur district Kabaddi association helped me to get a sponsor for my education,” Yalini said.

She says she is more passionate about kabaddi than academics. “For almost six years, I have been training in APJ Abdul Kalam Sports Academy at Thirumuruganpoondi. Though I was good in both kabaddi and athletics, I chose kabaddi when I got a seat in the sports hostel of Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu in Namakkal. I was trained in the sport for two years there,” she said.

Later, Yalini moved to Tirupur and joined APJ Abdul Kalam Sports Academy. “I improved my skill and got selected to the Tamil Nadu team. Unfortunately, we lost to Haryana in the finals by 25-20 score.”

I want to play kabaddi till I feel it is enough and represent India and win laurels for her, she says.

Yalini’s coach M Chinnappa Das at the academy says Yalini is one of the best players there. “We have 40 girls currently. It is an honour to us that she is from our academy,” he said. Though we face financial and other constraints, we try to give our best to the girls, he added.

288,['21/01/2020'],"How to balance studies &amp; co-curricular activities, Jabalpur girl asks PM Modi","This story is from January 21, 2020

Bhopal: A class 9 girl from Kendriya Vidyalaya in Garha, Jabalpur, got a chance to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi a question related to extra-curricular activities during ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ 2020, held at the Talkatora indoor stadium in New Delhi. A team of 50 students from Madhya Pradesh had also been selected to participate in the event.

Prajakta Atankar, the student from Jabalpur asked the PM, about how to balance studies and extra-curricular activities. She said it was difficult for her to strike a balance between studies and extra-curriculars as they created a distraction for her.

Answering her question, the PM said, “If you do not participate in extra-curricular activities and only keep doing the same thing – going to school and coming back home, as if you have been programmed, you will turn into a robot, which will not be beneficial to you, nor the country.”

“It is important to manage time so that you can participate in other activities and also give proper time to your studies. Don’t consider extra-curricular activities a waste of time,” added the PM.

On the same subject, he addressed the parents and asked them not to make co-curricular activities a burden on children by pressuring them to go to different classes and asking them to excel in every activity.

“Today, it has become a fashion-statement for parents to send their children for all kinds of classes before and after school. They then brag to their friends that their child is learning so many things and at the same time pressurize the children to learn things they do not even have an interest in. Parents should understand that these glamour-driven extra-curricular activities build unnecessary pressure on children, so they should refrain from such attitudes,” said PM Modi.

The 50 students, who went to attend the event from MP, were given souvenirs. They all got a chance to be a part of the interaction with Narendra Modi, even if they did not get a chance to ask their questions at the event.

“I had prepared a question about dealing with exam stress, but as another student asked the same, I got my answer even though I did not get a chance to ask the question myself. It was a wonderful experience to be there and I will remember it for years to come,” said Kritika Sen, a student of Class 11 of Deepak Memorial Academy, Sagar.

Hyderabad: Three minor boys, who went missing on Sunday from Neela village in Nizamabad district, were found drowned in a trench in the village. The bodies of the three boys — Siddharth, Deepak and Mukheed —were fished out on Monday after they were spotted in a trench.

Police said the three boys, all aged between 7 and 8 years, left their house on Sunday to play with motorcycle tyres.

While they were playing with tyres, they accidentally fell into a trench. Though police were not sure how the three fell into the trench, they suspect that the boys might have fallen at once into the trench, which was very deep.

The bodies were recovered by district authorities after swimmers were pressed into action. The bodies of the boys were sent to the area hospital for post-mortem examination.

COIMBATORE: The city police have denied permission to Coimbatore District All Jamaath and Federation of Islamic Organisations to conduct a rally against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from the VOC Park ground to the Codissia ground.

Representatives from the federation petitioned the police officials on January 17, seeking permission to conduct the rally on February 2 on Avinashi Road.

As Avinashi Road is a key arterial road that leads to hospitals, educational institutions and the international airport and as already construction works are slowing down vehicular movements on the road, police had denied permission for the rally, a police officer said.

Earlier on Monday, deputy commissioner of police (law&order) L Balaji Saravanan met a group of representatives from the organisations at his chamber. The DCP told them that already Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (KMMK), PFI, SDPI and all the jamaaths had conducted more than 50 protests against CAA in the city.

291,['21/01/2020'],Students ‘reap’ what they ‘sow’ in midday meals,"This story is from January 21, 2020

NAGPUR: A photo showing school students tending to their mini-farm on campus seems to have gone viral on WhatsApp groups, with people appreciating their efforts to grow vegetables for midday meals . The photos are from a zilla parishad (ZP) school located in a remote village of Bhamragad taluka of Gadchiroli district, where tribal students take pride in growing their own food for midday meals.

The Koyanguda ZP primary school is a small unit with just 32 students on rolls, but that does not deter them from trying to make a difference. This concept of growing vegetables on campus, popularly known as kitchen garden, is practised in quite a few government schools of Nagpur division after it was first mooted by the education department in 2012.

Koyanguda’s case is made unique by the fact that the land they are tilling does not belong to the school. Villager Vasudeo Ramsu Habka owns a piece of land adjoining the school and ‘donated’ a part of his holding, so that children could get ‘real life lessons’ and become stronger stakeholders in the midday meals scheme.

Principal Vinit Padmawar said, “We started this mini-farm last year and since then, have been able to generate a steady supply of fresh vegetables and fulfil daily requirements of green chillies, coriander etc. This has brought an immense change of attitude among children, who now see themselves as equal partners in the midday meals scheme.” Daily duties like watering the plants, plucking the daily kitchen requirements for tomatoes, chillies and identifying problems with the plants have been properly divided.

Nagesh Habka, whose father owns the mini-farm, says there’s something different about produce coming from that patch of land. “We all find it to be tastier than vegetables which come from the market or other farms,” he said over the phone. Padmawar believes that the ‘tasty’ part comes from their involvement in seeing their hard work pay off.

As of now, Koyanguda’s mini-farm produces ample weekly stock of brinjals, with students planning to diversify their stock. Padmawar said, “I hope that every school in the country does this as it will help create self reliance, and also teach children about how much hard work is required to bring food to our tables.”

Ahmedabad: The state government’s advertisement for the posts of the Gujarat RERA appellate tribunal’s chairman and member was challenged in the Gujarat high court on Monday.

The state government published an advertisement on January 4 inviting applications from qualified persons for the post of chairman and member of the Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) appellate tribunal. The advertisement was issued after the high court gave notice to the state government in response to a PIL demanding the appointments.

The PIL filed by advocate Nipun Singhvi objected to the present functioning of the appellate tribunal, which is being run by the presiding officer of the Gujarat State Food Safety Tribunal.

After the government came up with the advertisement, petitioner Singhvi objected to the mode of recruitment. He submitted before the HC that the law mandates that the chairman of Guj RERA appellate tribunal has to be appointed by the government in consultation with the chief justice of the high court. Inviting applications cannot be the method to fill the post.

Similarly, the petitioner has taken exception to the eligibility criteria laid down for the post of the tribunal’s member. The petitioner requested the high court to allow him to make changes in his PIL and to incorporate the challenge to the advertisement. The high court has granted the permission, said petitioner’s advocate Vishal Dave.

The petitioner has sought HC directions to the government to appoint people for the post of chairperson and members in the tribunal by following the procedure laid down in Section 46 of the RERA act.

The HC is to hear the issue further two weeks later.

Sources said that on Monday a three-member team of the NMC reached the college and carried out a surprise check and found no doctors and staff present. On inquiring, they found that the staff was on leave because of the wedding season.

The team which carried out the raid continued its checking in the institute till late at night. Officials said that usually such surprise inspections are never carried out by the NMC.

Officials said no such report pointing out discrepancies was submitted by the NMC to the government or to the institute.

Officials that after this surprise visit, there is a possibility that the college might see a cut in the number of seats or face a heavy penalty. The college has 150 medical seats. The team also inspected facilities at Himmatnagar Government Medical College. The college is managed by ther Gujarat Medical Education Research Society and has 150 seats.

Panaji: South Goa Comunidades Forum stated that comunidades do not receive any funding from the government and hence are not required to share records or information beyond their organisation.

Reacting to the order of the state information commission to declare comunidades as public authorities for effective implementation of the right to information act, the forum stated that the issue of whether comunidades are public bodies or not is pending in the high court in a number of writ petitions. In an earlier decision, the high court held them to be private bodies, the forum stated.

Forum secretary Savio Correia said that comunidades are autonomous bodies where the government only exercises administrative tutelage. “Much before coming into force of the RTI Act, the code of comunidades had envisaged the need for dissemination of information relating to its functioning among its shareholders and enabled it under Article 26 (7) and Article 88 (d),” Correia stated.

He added that protection of a private body from alleged loot and plunder cannot be grounds for recommending it to be declared as a public authority under RTI Act.

President of the Guirim comunidade and member of the erstwhile comunidade commission Tulio D’Souza said the existing code of comunidade provides sufficient transparency. “The comunidade is duty bound to provide information within the general body of its component but not to the public at large,” he said.

The government, he added, can direct comunidades to provide any information through the administrator of comunidades under sec 88(d). “It remains to be seen if any notification as directed by the state information commission order can be issued by the government within the provisions of the existing code of comunidade,” D’Souza said.

AHMEDABAD: When a lion and a cub were spotted in Dedhuki village near the temple town of Chotila in Surendranagar, they hit the headlines. Reports suggested that the big cats — whose population is burgeoning in Gir — had extended their footprints to another district! Informal estimates have pegged the lion population to be more than 700.Two months later, the lion and the cub may have become homesick. The state forest department is abuzz with speculation that the two are headed home to Amreli. “The lions have started retreating from Chotila, having trekked 150km over the past four days to Sardhar. Their movement was recorded last at Aji Dam near Rajkot city,” said S K Srivastava, the chief conservator of forest of Junagadh .Sandeep Kumar, the deputy conservator of forest (DCF) of Morbi, who is monitoring the movement of the lion and the cub, said that the extensive movement indicated that the lion is either searching for a suitable place or a mating partner to establish its own territory. “It is highly possible that it might settle down once it finds a partner,” said Kumar. “The other possibility is that the two lions may have got lost and have begun the journey to get back home.”Officials said that the lions were spotted in Dedhuki on November 20. This was significant as it marked the entry of lions into the sixth district of the state.

Trichy: One of the largest temples for Shridi Sai Baba in south India, Akkaraipatti Sai Baba temple complex, was consecrated near Samayapuram here on Monday. Thousands of people from various parts of the state thronged the complex to witness the rituals.

Coined by the devotees as south Shirdi, home for the 19th-century saint Sai Baba, the Akkaraipatti Sai baba temple has a plinth area of 35,000sqft. The basement is likely to be used for yoga and meditation purposes. The ground floor of the complex accommodates a massive statue of the saint. The first floor of the complex has provisions for devotees to witness pujas from the corridors.

The complex also has four sub-shrines, including one for Vinayaka. Sources involved in the construction said that the work on the complex taken up at the end of 2015 was completed in December 2019. The consecration rituals were initiated by the priests by 7am. Around 9.30am, the kalasam of the temple situated at a height of 100ft was consecrated by priests by pouring holy water. The temple is situated about 4km from the Samayapuram toll plaza on the Chennai - Trichy national highway.

Trichy: The Thanjai Periyakoil Urimai Meetpukkuzhu (Thanjavur Big temple Rights Retrieval Committee) has planned to conduct a day-long conference at the Cauvery wedding hall in Nanjikottai in Thanjavur on Wednesday demanding the conduct of consecration ceremony of Brihadeeswara temple in Tamil.

The committee is opposing the consecration and associated rituals in Sanskrit. The meet is expected to be attended by spiritual leaders and Tamil scholars. Addressing reporters on Monday, P Maniyarasan, coordinator of the committee said, “Hinduism has multiple facets and worshipping procedures. Thanjavur Peruvudaiyur temple belongs to Tamil Saivism. Hence, conducting the consecration ceremony in Sanskrit is completely unacceptable.” Brihadeeswara temple, one of Unesco’s world heritage sites, has been gearing up for the consecration ceremony planned on February 5.

“Various political parties and organisations have expressed their stand by reiterating the need to conduct the consecration of Peruvudaiyar temple in Tamil instead of Sanskrit. Tamil Nadu government should take a decision in favour of Tamil language since the temple is considered as the cultural, architectural and spiritual identity of Tamils,” Maniyarasan added. TNN

BHOPAL: A day after a pro-CAA rally by BJP supporters in Rajgarh where protestors clashed with district administration, police identified 124 of the 500 people and arrested 12 people on Monday for violating section 144.

“Of the 12 people, including five women have been arrested. Search for other people among the 124 identified is going on and we are also trying to identify other protestors through the video footages,” Rajgarh SP Pradeep Sharma told TOI.

He added, “approximately 500 people have participated in the protests, these are estimates as per the statements of the officials. Numbers would be clear once we verify the video footages.

Apart from it, we have also arrested one person on the complaint by a female officer who alleged she was assaulted. One of the two accused, Bhupendra Rajput resident of Rajgarh was arrested and produced before court. We sought remand of the accused for one day,” Sharma said.

“We have the pictures of other accused but he is yet to be identified,” he said.

In the meantime, local BJP workers handed over a complaint urging the police to register a case against district collector Nidhi Nivedita.

On Sunday despite prohibitory orders, BJP workers led by former MLAs Amar Singh Yadav, Mohan Sharma and district president of BJP Dilbar Singh Yadav, took out a ‘tiranga yatra’ in support of CAA in Biaora town on Sunday. The situation took an ugly turn when district collector and another female officer had to take control of the situation. They lost their cool, and slapped protestors.

Ahmedabad: If you are a salary account holder in a public-sector bank, chances are your pay might get stalled by three days, as public-sector banks will remain shut from January 31 to February 2 as bank employees will go on a two-day strike on January 31-February 1 (Friday and Saturday). As Sunday happens to be a bank holiday, public sector banks across Gujarat will remain shut for three consecutive days.

Some 70,000 bank employees and officers from across public sector banks in Gujarat are expected to go on a strike on these two days to protest non-revision of their wages. In fact, bank employees also held a demonstration outside UCO Bank on Monday evening to protest non-revision of wages. “The wage revision for bank employees has been pending since November 2012. Last year, banks made a provision worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore from their own profits for writing off non-performing assets (NPAs). Banks must make efforts to revise wages of their own employees,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA).

Apart from wage revision, bank employees have also sought to initiate recruitment in banks. “We want the of new pension scheme for bankers to be scrapped have urged the government to re-initiate recruitment in the banking sector,” Rawal added.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Monday asked the state government to pay compensation to the latest owner of a land parcel in Kutch district, which was acquired by the government upon paying the compensation to the previous owners.

To the HC’s insistence that the state government should pay the new owner, Bhadresh Shah, the state government submitted that it would inform the court on Thursday about whether it would pay the entire compensation amount to the new owner, said Shah’s advocate Nirav Sanghvi.

The previous owners of the land, who had accepted the land compensation have been put behind bars by the administration. Proceedings have been initiated against a few revenue officials also for the goof.

In this case, Shah had purchased a piece of land in Nani Chher village of Lakhpat taluka in Kutch in 2006 and made payment to the previous owners, a Padiar family. A year later, the authorities initiated land acquisition process in the area for the Gujarat Mineral Corporation Ltd. The plot sold to Shah was also acquired. However, the compensation was paid to the Padiars after the process was over in 2011.

Shah took up the issue before the authorities, but nothing happened. He insisted that the revenue department should file a suit in court against the previous owners. With this demand, Shah approached the high court last year. The HC had called for records and summoned the district collector for explanation.

Finally, following the HC directions, the government lodged an FIR against the previous landowners, and initiated departmental proceedings against revenue officials.

COIMBATORE: The city police had registered the second highest number of drunken driving cases — 16,451 — in the state in 2019.

While the Chennai city police had registered about 48,000 cases, the Madurai city police had filed 9,900 cases in the same period. Police have already started cracking down this year as 1,140 cases of drunken driving have been registered in the city from January 1. To prevent fatal accidents in the city, police have been booking at least 60 cases of drunken driving every day, city police commissioner Sumit Sharan said. “We don’t collect spot fine for drunken driving as we sent the report to the court. The drunken drivers are fined Rs 10,000 each by the court,” he said.

While 132 people lost their lives in road mishaps in the city in 2019, it was 162 in 2018. The fatal accidents came down because of various efforts taken by the city police, he said. “Now, we started cracking down on vehicles using LED lights and air horns. The court imposes a fine of Rs 10,000 for using LED lights on two wheelers and other vehicles. In the case of air horns, we collect fine of Rs 1,000 penalty,” he said, adding, more cases will be filed against people violating traffic rules.

Trichy: The move by Bharathidasan University (BDU) vice-chancellor P Manisankar to select candidates through an ad hoc committee has raised several eyebrows as 11 candidates will be interviewed for two statutory posts on Tuesday.

The university intends to appoint two directors for the centre for distance education (CDE) and the council for curriculum and career development (CCCD). Data accessed by TOI reveal that five candidates have been shortlisted for CDE, but none meets the minimum eligibility criteria.

A senior faculty said the university is most likely to face objection from local fund audit if it goes ahead with the appointment through an ad hoc committee, adding that the directors hired the last two times were appointed after constituting a statutory committee.

The committee will comprise a nominee each from the governor’s office and state government, unlike in the case of the selection committee constituted by incumbent syndicate members, said the official.

An highly-placed source from the university said that candidates have already been selected for the post and interview is a mere formality. “This is perhaps the reason why the university received just 11 applications for the post,” said a senior faculty from BDU.

When asked about ineligible candidates for CDE director, BDU registrar G Gopinath, said that a scrutiny committee constituted by the vice-chancellor has scrutinised the applications based on which candidates have been called for the interview on Tuesday.

Asked as to why only 11 applications were received for the posts when direct recruitment of 54 faculty positions received 1,600 applications, Gopinath said faculty positions were from multiple departments, but for applying for a director’s post, a candidate should at least be an associate professor. Further, the post is for a three-year tenure.

Vijayawada: Amid uproarious scenes, the Andhra Pradesh assembly on Monday night passed two bills paving way for three capital cities in the state, signalling the end of the road for the much-touted greenfield capital in Amaravati.

With the passing of the two bills, the YSRC government led by Y S Jaganmohan Reddy scored a huge political victory over former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu.

Unfazed by the ongoing protests by farmers in the capital city region in Amaravati, the government introduced the two bills for the trifurcation of the capital. After the day-long discussion on both bills, the assembly passed the bills with voice vote. Speaker Tammineni Sitaram suspended 17 TDP legislators.

TDP is now planning to stall the bill in the legislative council where it enjoys majority.

On Monday morning, the cabinet met ahead of the assembly session and approved the bills which were then discussed in the assembly Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting. After the BAC meeting, the bills were introduced in the assembly paving the way for the trifurcation of the capital.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath introduced the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions (APDIDAR) Act 2020.

Spooked by recent reports of data from guests’ credit card being stolen at restaurants

KOLKATA: Spooked by recent reports of data from guests’ credit card being stolen at restaurants, hoteliers and restaurateurs have decided to put in place safety measures and issue an advisory to customers.

The owner of a restaurant from where cases of data theft was detected got so rattled initially that he had even considered stopping card transactions only to realise that it was not a practical option given that 65%-70% customers pay their bill with plastic money.

“Card data theft is an extremely grave issue. It threatens the reputation of a business. If there is a theft from the cash box, it is an internal matter. But if a client's credit or debit card data is skimmed at a restaurant, not only will the customer never return, the news will spread over word of mouth and the reputation of the place will be tarnished forever. People will not trust the place any more. It doesn't matter if a professional gang that managed to infiltrate did it with no knowledge or involvement of either the owner or the managers, we cannot shrug off responsibility since it happened on the premises. We have to act to save our reputation,” he said.

Among the measures that several restaurant owners have either already taken or are in the process of doing so is fix responsibility. “Only hand-picked few trusted staff who have been working in the establishment for several years will handle the point-of-sale (POS) terminal used for card transactions,” said Suresh Poddar, who owns multiple restaurants in the central business district and is also the HRAEI secretary.

That is a significant change from the earlier practice of the waiter assigned to a table carrying the POS to the customer at the end of the meal. With only three of four persons now allowed to handle POS terminals, restaurateurs believe the machines will be more secure and the likelihood of customers being defrauded remote. “Fixing responsibility will act as a deterrent. If a fraud still does occur, the person can be easily identified. It will be one of the persons to whom the task has been assigned,” Poddar pointed out.

The POS terminal ‘handlers’, who are in several instances the managers who take the order, are also being taught card transaction etiquette that includes looking the other way when a guest enters the PIN. “Most POS terminals now have a cover over the keypad to hide the fingers when the PIN is being keyed in. Looking away only adds to the customer's sense of comfort and security,” explained Pranav Singh , president of HRAEI that has 1,000-plus members.

While restaurants are taking precautions, HRAEI functionaries also realise the need to caution customers. “We will make our premises safe. But customers, too, should be aware of what they are entitled to and how they should handle cards. We are preparing an advisory that will be issued soon,” said Poddar.

A draft of the customer notification that is proposed to be displayed by the HRAEI members is ready and will be handed out to all restaurants after it is ratified at the next meeting of the association in February where the issue of credit card fraud is listed on the agenda.

Minister for law PC Sharma claimed that misbehavior with women is part of the BJP-RSS culture. “Section 144 was imposed in Rajgarh. If they had to do a protest, then a permission should have been taken. This woman collector and deputy collector had been working in the same capacity during BJP tenure also. No such incident took place then,” he argued. “BJP demonstrators took law into their hands. They pulled the deputy collector by her hair and kicked her on the waist. This kind of misbehaviour is culture of the BJP-RSS. Such behaviour with women is unfortunate and condemnable.”

The police were able to corner the patrol car belonging to Nakkapalli circle police station only after a high-speed chase that lasted a little over 2 km. Luckily, no one was injured despite the ‘unstable’ man’s rash driving.

Nakkapalli police personnel TOI spoke to said the incident took place around 12.10 am along the highway when they were discussing measures to control the farmers’ agitation in Amaravati and the preventive arrest of TDP leaders who were accused of ‘instigating the ryots’. An inquiry revealed the man in question was mentally ill and wasn’t acting with any political motive. A memo has been issued to the driver of the patrol vehicle for negligence and dereliction of duty.

“We came to know the accused is mentally challenged. Our driver’s negligence caused the confusion. We have issued a memo to him. All we can say is we are fortunate the incident took place late in the night. Had it happened in the morning or evening, the situation would have been completely different,” an senior police official said, adding it was a miracle no one suffered injuries.

Panaji: The state government will issue a fare chart for taxis within 15 days, which will pave the way for digital meters to be installed in taxis.

In the contempt petition filed by the travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG) over non implementation of taxi meters, advocate general Devidas Pangam told the high court that the government will notify the revised fare rates within fifteen days, after which installation of digital meters in taxis can begin. The revised fare rates have already been vetted by the law department and submitted to the government for approval.

Senior counsel Nitin Sardesai representing TTAG asked for a date by which the meters would be installed.

Counsel Suren Uppal representing Rosmerta Autotech Pvt Ltd, to whom the work order has been awarded, informed the high court that the company was ready to install the meters within a week’s time following the government’s notification of the revised fare chart.

Pangam stated that the implementation of meters in taxis on pilot basis began on November 26, and has been successful.

The pilot installation and operation of the meters, as well as the pilot running of the central tracking response system (CTRS) has been completed, the government submitted to the HC. The transport department had also sent a letter to the director general of police on January 3 for the integration of the CTRS with the state emergency response system.

TTAG filed a contempt petition after the transport department failed to comply with the court’s July 5 order of fitting taxis with meters.

The government in November tendered an apology to the HC over delay in implementation of the digital meters, and the transport department was asked to explain its failure to do so after a show cause notice was issued by the high court.

Panaji:The Goa tourism development corporation’s loss-making Calangute Annexe, a hotel with 30 rooms, spread over an area of 1,214sqm, will be renovated through a private player.

Targeted at middle-class travelers, the Calangute Annexe, despite enjoying a prime location, has not made a profit over the past five years.

A member of the board said there have been complaints about the property, and it needs to be renovated.

“The board has opted to have a private investor redo the property and operate it, but no structural changes will be permitted,” he said.

He added that the board was informed that the trend in revenues and profit margins of the facility has not changed much in five years, nor has the average room rent been modified.

“The rent has been kept on the lower side due to stiff competition from better placed hotels in the area,” he said. The no-frills resort charges Rs 2,100 to 3,000 for a standard room during peak season, and Rs 2,500 to 3,600 for an airconditioned room. Room tariff is lowed during the monsoon.

Rintu Das watches a match from the sidelines; at his home with his son

KOLKATA: An ardent Mohun Bagan fan and a double amputee missed a Derby in Kolkata for the first time in 19 years after a car hit his hand-cycle when he was on his way to the Salt Lake stadium on Sunday.

Ballygunge resident Rintu Das (29), a familiar face among Mohun Bagan fans and officials, said he was distraught after missing the game, which dented his enviable record. “Never have I missed a Derby in Kolkata since the age of 10. Even after I lost both my legs in a train accident in 2012, I went to the stadium on a wheelchair with a group of friends and cheered for my team. I was also geared up to root for my team from the side line on Sunday but then the accident happened. When I woke up at the hospital on Sunday night, I rued at missing out the live action but was happy that my team had won,” said Das, who lives in the Peyarabagan slum with his wife and six-year-old son.

On Sunday, Das was on his way to the stadium on his hand-cycle fluttering flags of Mohun Bagan and India. Just as he reached the stadium, he was hit by a car from behind and was flung off his hand-cycle. “It was a red car that dashed me from behind and sped away. I couldn’t notice the registration number of the car,” Das told TOI on Monday.

As he fell off the tricycle, Mohun Bagan fans picked him up and rushed towards the other side of the road where cops brought a police ambulance shifted him to NRS Hospital. Doctors said he had suffered sprain injuries on his neck, spine, shoulder and trauma on his head. However, there were no fractures.

“He has always been crazy about Mohun Bagan. Even after the accident, the first thing he asked after regaining consciousness was the score for Sunday’s match,” said Namita, his wife. Das was released from the hospital on Monday.

A passionate footballer himself, Das used play as a goalkeeper for a local club – Bhai Bhai Sangha – till he met with the accident in 2012. “We had won a tournament beating a Kalighat club in the final match before I went for a vacation with my wife to Delhi. But on March 2, during the train journey, I fell off the train near Ghaziabad and my legs came under the train wheels. I was bedridden for three months. But then, I was up again on a hand-cycle and was back to the ground.

Football fans were livid on Facebook after news of his accident went viral. “I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from anxious fans and this is what keeps me going. I love my team and would continue to support it even if they merge with ATK or any other team. My love for the team will remain intact,” said Das.

PANAJI: Goa police on Monday opposed the anticipatory bail application filed by panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho ’s brother, Wilson, before the sessions court apprehending arrest in former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik’s death case.

Old Goa police filed their reply in the case and argument will be heard on Tuesday. Police on Sunday filed an FIR against Wilson for abetment of suicide in the case.

Wilson in his application said that he is “innocent” and that the allegations made by Naik in a WhatApp message that has since gone viral, are “patently false”.

Naik, who was a sitting Merces panch member, allegedly shot himself minutes after posting the message on a 200-member strong group. The message stated that he was “under tremendous pressure” from two persons over a property matter, which he could not handle.

In his application Wilson stated that “Naik has falsely alleged” that he had been harassing Naik.

“There is absolute no business dealings between me and Naik,” Wilson’s application stated. The only connection between them is a panchayat case, the application further stated.

Stating that political parties are calling for his arrest saying he is the panchayat minister’s brother, Wilson’s in his application said these political parties were seeking to take political mileage of unfortunate suicide. He also stated that he is not involved in any criminal offence as alleged in the FIR.

The applicant said he has strong reasons to believe that on account of the political pressure and influence exerted, some malicious plans and designs had been worked out with the intention of implicating him with cognisable and non-bailable offences.

During the hearing on Monday, Wilson’s counsel Rohit Bras de Sa said that they had not been provided with a copy of the FIR.

“I sympathise with Naik’s family. I am for a fair investigation, which should reach its logical conclusion,” Wilson told reporters outside the court.

Naik had contested assembly elections in 2017 on the ticket of the state’s oldest regional party, MGP.

On Monday, the Naik family took possession of the the body and performed the final rites. Earlier they had refused to accept the body till the two persons named in the message were arrested.

They also demanded that the case be moved from the Old Goa police to crime branch.

AHMEDABAD: When city-based designer Lokesh Ghai started working with 14 students from across the campuses of the National Institute of Design ( NID ) for a two-week open elective course, he was clear about the outcome. “I wanted the students to experience the compassion of society to inspire them. I took them to less-known individual and NGO-driven initiatives, where they listened and captured the experience in words and sketches,” he said.

The result is the ‘Wrapped in Compassion’ booklet, featuring 14 such intitiatives from Ahmedabad and covers areas ranging from women’s empowerment to the environment and education to charity. The course was taken by students of disciplines such as film and video communication, retail design, furniture design, automobile design and so on.

In search of missing children

The ‘Search my Child’ movement may have started with a missing girl in 2012 but Sanjay Joshi, a social worker, soon realized that his was not a solitary case. Joshi’s profile mentions how the movement snowballed into a phenomenon where the FIRs for missing children started getting registered under the section of the IPC dealing with kidnapping.

324,['21/01/2020'],"Budget basics: Focus on power, water, say Goa’s industrialists","This story is from January 21, 2020

Panaji: The Union Budget, which is around the corner, is expected to outline steps to stimulate economic growth but expectations from the state budget are much lower. While Goa’s industrial sector is also counting on a turnaround, the captains of Goa’s private sector want the state government to focus on the basics -power, water, public transport and less red-tape.

The government might not admit it, but all the major sectors that contribute to the state’s tax kitty have witnessed a slump, say trade bodies.

Goa State Industries Association has submitted a budget wish list to the state government, highlighting steps to revive Goa’s mining, manufacturing and tourism sector.

“What is below the soil is the property of the government and we, the people living in the state, are stakeholders of the same. The government has to take over all mines under a corporation and tender mining activity and ore-selling activity separately,” said president of GSIA, Damodar Kochkar.

Kochkar has also listed eight steps, which the government can take to boost the manufacturing units. These include digitisation of all government departments through an online platform and reforms in industrial laws to make them business-friendly.

Basic issues such as consistent power supply, cheap availability of raw water, public transport, improvement of health services and cleanliness also need the state government’s attention, said Kochkar.

Verna Industries Association president Blaise Costabir also stresses that the basics need to be put in place. “A raw water supply network, akin to the one in Verna, needs to be expanded to different industrial estates and raw water rates need to be stabilised . For industry, incentivise water treatment plants, which in turn will help reduce the demand for water,” said Costabir. Both Costabir and Kochkar hope that chief minister Pramod Sawant will announce a reduction in raw water supply rates as promised by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar.

Speaking about power supply, Costabir recommends that the state needs to aggressively promote solar energy. “We want new industries, we want more jobs, but we don’t have electricity. We already have the policy in place for solar or renewable energy, but we have not moved aggressively on this. The government needs to encourage solar power generation,” he said.

The real estate sector is also reeling under poor demand. Credai – Goa, which is likely to give its budget recommendations in the next few days, is looking at a reduction in the infrastructure tax levied on all real estate projects.

Thanjavur: Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday dedicated the newly-resurrected 222 Squadron, the Tigersharks, with BrahMos-embedded Sukhoi-30MKIs to the nation at a function held at the Air Force Station (AFS) in Thanjavur.

With the Sukhoi-30 MKI squadron now getting positioned at AFS in Thanjavur along with BrahMos Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), the Indian Air Force (IAF) will get more air power to strike at any target at sea and on land with pinpoint accuracy during day and night and in all weather conditions, officials said.

The IAF test-fired the BrahMos ALCM from a Sukhoi-30MKI on May 22, 2019. It was the successful second test-firing of the BrahMos ALCM from a Su-30MKI, where the missile achieved a direct hit on the target, thus proving its high accuracy hit rate, officials added.

Addressing a gathering of a Sukhoi-30 fighter squadron, General Rawat said, “Su-30 MKI along with the BrahMos will be a gamechanger which will extensively enhance the security of the maritime domain. The Squadron will operate closely with the Indian Army and Navy to get the ball rolling in jointness of the Indian Armed Forces.”

Chief of Air Staff R K S Bhaduria said the mission was a huge achievement as the entire modification with Sukhoi-30MKI had been done indigenously with no historical background.

“Be it in terms of air defence of this southern peninsula, especially in view of some critical national assets in this area of responsibility, be it in the maritime road in support of Navy, or be it in any other offensive or defensive role, this aircraft is capable of any mission assigned by the Air Force,” he said.

Vice Admiral Atul Kumar Jain, Air Marshal Amit Tiwari, chairman, DRDO, Dr G Satheesh Reddy and chairman-cum-managing director, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, R Madhavan, participated.

COIMBATORE: Higher secondary students from around 150 government schools in the district on Monday saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s speech at the ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020’ programme held in New Delhi, live. However, not all would have understood what he said. While at some government schools, teachers who knew Hindi acted as interpreters and paraphrased PM’s speech to students, other schools did not have such a facility.

School education officials said the PM’s speech was played alive in around 150 government high and higher secondary schools, which had ‘hi-tech’ classrooms, in the district.

When TOI visited the CCMA Government Girls Higher Secondary School on Raja Street in the city, more than 50 students were watching the PM’s speech on how to beat examination stress. A teacher was simultaneously translating his speech into Tamil. “He now says marks are not the goal in life. Life is more than just marks, he says,” she was saying to students.

In Ashokapuram Government Higher Secondary School too, an interpreter translated the PM’s speech to students, in a rather simplistic way.

However, in several other government schools in the district, there were no such arrangements, as not all government schools had teachers familiar with Hindi.

A government school teacher said in government schools outside the city, there were none to interpret Modi’s speech, and students had to just sit and watch the visual.

When asked about this, Coimbatore chief education officer P Ayyannan agreed that not all schools in the districts had such an arrangement. “Not all government schools would have teachers who know Hindi. Wherever possible, we have arranged for them to interpret,” he said. “However, we plan to translate Prime Minister’s speech and read it out in school assembly meetings in two days,” he added.

NASHIK: The city police have withdrawn the services of 370 home guards following instructions from the police department headquarters in Mumbai.

In October last year, 370 out of 400 home guards had joined the police force. The home guards assisted the police force in bandobast, in police chowky level work, police station level, court bandobast, Kaidee Party, for vehicular traffic regulation etc.

DCP (HQ and Traffic) Pournima Chaugule said, “The services of the home guards were discontinued a couple of days back after instructions from our higher offices. Nonetheless, we would be able to use the home guards, for important events and occasions like election, Ganapati, Navaratra, etc.”

Meanwhile, a senior police officer of the city police said that there is approximately 3,000 police personnel with the city police, which work in shifts. For a city with a population of close to 19 lakh and the floating population, the force available with the police is very less. “The home guards were of great help at the newly formed police chowkies. Fifty-four new police chowkies came up under the jurisdictions of the 13 police stations. Thus in the absence of the police personnel of the concerned police station, the home guards manned the chowkies and also entertained the complainants till the arrival of the concerned officer,” said an officer.

Further, the home guards were also useful in managing vehicular traffic. Senior officials said that the decision of discontinuing the services of the home guards was mainly related to the remuneration they had to be paid for their services.

The city expansion is happening fast with newer areas coming in all the direction. “In a bid to maintain law and order, preventing crimes from taking place and detecting them after they have occurred, the available force is too small.”

Meanwhile, in view of the growth of the city, there are proposals to set up new police stations and also include a few police stations with the rural police. On the backdrop of all such things, the police would be needing additional forces.

Kolkata Municipal Corporation

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) assessment department has made changes in the application form for existing property tax-payers to enable them switch over to the Unit Area Assessment (UAA) method.

Explaining the reason behind the move, mayor Firhad Hakim on Monday said it was necessary to make the form simple as majority of tax-payers were getting baffled by the unnecessary complications that existed in the old form. “Our officials were getting negative feedback about the form because of its length and unexplained complications. Now, we have done away with irrelevant matters and made the form citizen-friendly,” Hakim said.

Deputy mayor Atin Ghosh held a meeting with senior KMC assessment department officials during the day and asked them to arrange for help desks in borough offices to make tax-payers aware about the change in the application form. “We were committed to make changes in the UAA application form so that tax-payers don’t find it complex and refrain from switching over to the new tax regime,” Ghosh said.

According to a KMC assessment department official, the new form has been made slimmer by cutting down unnecessary instructions that were given to tax-payers in the older version. “This apart, we have deleted large portions of information from the previous UAA form which were not relevant for tax-payers. Cluttering of information proved to be detrimental for the tax-payers’ understanding of the new system,” said a KMC official in the assessment department. A KMC revenue department official said the new form would be a two-page document that will be self-explanatory and easy to understand.

Biswanath Chakraborty, who was injured on Sunday

KOLKATA: Two East Bengal fans were injured — one of them seriously — when a brick hit their bus while they were returning home after watching Sunday’s Derby. The brick was hurled at the bus near Apollo Hospital almost immediatetly after the supporters from Andul had boarded it. While one of them — Biswanath Chakraborty — has received seven stitches, the other person, Bijan Bhattacharjee , escaped with minor injuries.

“We, a group of 45 East Bengal supporters, had hired a bus to go to the stadium. When we were returning home, our bus had taken a U-turn and moved towards Kadapara when some men standing under the Metro station and claiming allegiance to a fan club started abusing us. First it was against our club, and then it became personal. One of our supporters tried to reply when stones started raining on us. A brick hit the back of the head of Chakraborty, who was sitting near the gate,” claimed Bhattacharjee.

At Apollo Hospital, club members and supporters, who had lined up for the treatment of footballer Edmund Lalrindika, pooled money for the initial treatment of Chakraborty. Several Mohun Bagan supporters turned up at the hospital from Andul to express their solidarity with the victims.

Phoolbagan police said a case of hurt had been registered. “Some unknown persons voluntarily assaulted the complainant’s friend — Biswanath Chakraborty — by throwing a brick when the complainant along with others were on their way to their residence in a bus,” said an investigating officer.

334,['21/01/2020'],Parking woes: GMC to issue passes to doctors,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Taxis, private vehicles and hearses occupy most of the parking area

PANAJI: Facing a major parking space crunch, Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim will shortly start issuing its doctors passes to enable them to park their vehicles without difficulty within hospital premises. Besides, zones will be earmarked for the purpose.

Dean Dr S M Bandekar told TOI that “they have proposed to have passes issued to doctors that will enable them to park their vehicles in a designated zone.”

In a meeting held last week which was attended by heads of the departments, the parking issue was discussed, with doctors insisting that a solution be found at the earliest. Though the state’s biggest hospital has space earmarked for vehicles owned by its staff, it is inadequate— especially in view of GMC’s expansion this year.

The problem, a senior doctor said, is exacerbated further as many private vehicles – vehicles for hire, private ambulances and hearse vans – are parked in the GMC premises, leaving little to no space for doctors and other staff to park their vehicles.

“Nowhere else are private ambulances and vehicles on hire allowed to park within hospital premises. They take up most of the parking space. When we reach the hospital in the morning, we have to waste at least 10-15 minutes of our valuable time looking for parking,” said a senior doctor. Besides, visitors to the hospital also bring their vehicles. Once slots reserved for public vehicles are filled, motorists go looking for parking elsewhere within the hospital campus. Students’ vehicles – four wheelers – also take a lot of space. Bandekar said students will be asked to park their vehicles at the hostel.

Earlier, many people travelling from Panaji to Vasco or Margao for work, used to park their four-wheelers inside the GMC compound and take a south-bound bus from Bambolim. In the evening, they would return and pick up their vehicle to travel home. While this has reduced to a large extent, a GMC doctor said, more wings have been added to the hospital, and there has not been proportionate expansion in parking space. “Now, you see even vehicles parked outside GMC since there is no space inside. Plus, there are vegetable and fruit vendors adding to the chaos,” said a GMC staffer.

336,['21/01/2020'],"GST rules hard on us, say micro, small industrialists","This story is from January 21, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Micro and small industrialists from the district say the current GST rules were hard on them. The practice of blocking the facility to generate e-way bill on the instance of not filing GST returns for two months, they say, has put them in a tight spot.

They say amid reduced orders and payments not coming in in time, they were not able to pay GST returns on time and such stringent measures has been causing even more hardships.

Micro and small jobwork industrialists and cottage industrialists say they need e-way bill for transporting material worth more than Rs1lakh. If they don’t have an e-way bill, they would be heavily penalised.

J James, district president Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises’ (TACT), said on one side, their orders have reduced, and firms were giving them payment for their work only after 180 days, which has made it hard for them to file GST returns on time. “Now, with our e-way bill generation facilities being blocked for not filing GST returns on time, the situation has become worse,” he said.

James said of the micro jobwork and spare parts industries at Edayarpalayam and surrounding areas, the e-way bill generation facility of around 15 to 20 micro firms have been blocked due to non-filing of returns for two months. “We suspect the number to be around 100 across the district,” he said.

Members of the Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (Cotma) had recently submitted a petition regarding this to the principal GST commissioner in the city.

President of Cotma C Sivakumar said both public sector undertakings and private firms have been delaying payments of late. “Even the firms which had earlier been paying us within 45 days are now delaying it up to 180 days citing economic slowdown,” he said. The rule that non-filing of returns for six months would lead to the blocking of GST account has also put them in a tough spot, he said.

James said while such drastic measures would help in seeing better GST returns by the government, it would eventually affect the micro and small industry ecosystem. Sivakumar said they were expecting something positive in the upcoming budget.

When contacted, a GST official in the district said the process of blocking e-way bill generation was automated. “It was brought last year to penalise defaulters. But if they file the pending returns, it would be released immediately,” the official said. While acknowledging the issue faced by micro and small industries, the official said they should represent it to the Central GST commission as it was a policy matter.

SALEM: The organs of a 58-year-old brain dead man were successfully harvested at the government hospital in the city on Monday.

The authorities of Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital said that this was the first time a multiple organ harvest and transplant was performed at the hospital.

The authorities said Sivalingam, of Nallipalayam in Namakkal district , met with an accident on January 15 and was referred from the Namakkal government hospital to Salem as his condition deteriorated. However, even as treatment was underway at Salem GH, he suffered brain death around 1am on Monday.

In a noble gesture, his son Ramalingam agreed to donate the organs of his brain-dead father.

Subsequently, his heart was harvested and sent to a Chennai hospital and successfully transplanted on a patient while one kidney was donated to a patient in a private hospital in Coimbatore and the other kidney to a patient in Salem GH.

“A team of 21 health staff led by transplant surgeon Periyasamy performed the exercise soon after the donor’s son gave the consent. This is the first time that a transplant surgery was performed in Salem GH,” said the hospital dean R Balaji Nathan.

Madurai: The state government has been directed to file a response to an appeal filed by seven village administrative officers (VAO) challenging an order by a single judge who directed the district collectors to constitute a special grievance cell to inquire and take action on complaints from the public regarding VAOs not residing in their jurisdictional village.

In the appeal petition, the seven VAOs stated that a petition was filed before the Madras high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction for the VAO of Melaiyur village in Thanjavur district. They stated that the judge in his order on July 1, 2019, expanded the scope of the petition which touches upon the entire state and passed a series of direction which includes the constitution of special grievance cells in all districts. They stated that VAOs were entrusted with a plethora of duties which includes preparation and maintenance of village revenue and land records, collection of various taxes issuance of certificates and other important functions. The VAOs have also dedicated a major portion of their efforts and energy towards the upkeep and well-being of their respective villages.

They said that they are often left struggling to find any decent accommodation in the village where they are posted. Sometimes the area of posting maybe an isolated village with no road connectivity, lack of infrastructure facilities. They further said that women VAOs face difficulties without proper accommodation and even office without toilet facilities.

The petitioners said they are present in the office during working hours and only leave during the night hours. In the present day advancements in technology, the continuous presence of the VAOs in the village becomes obsolete.

They stated that the order was passed without even providing an opportunity to hear the VAOs or their associations. Hence, they filed an appeal before the high court Madurai bench. When the appeal was taken up for hearing on Monday, sought response from the state government and adjourned the case to February 7 for further hearing.

Panaji: MGP on Monday demanded that panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho resign from the cabinet to pave way for a free and fair investigation in former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik’s alleged suicide case. Godinho’s brother Wilson has been booked for abetment of suicide in the case.

MGP’s Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said they support Congress’ demand for Godinho’s resignation in the matter for the same reason.

Dhavalikar said that even though Naik’s death has been called suicide, he suspected foul play. “This is not suicide, it is murder, because he has named two persons, including the brother of the minister,” he said.

“Till date they have not been arrested and we want to know the reason for not arresting them,” the former deputy chief minister said.

Stating that chief minister Pramod Sawant should take note of this incident, Dhavalikar said that since 2002 Goa has seen land mafia. “According to my information, from 2002, till date, the land mafia has purchased lot of land in the state, which does not have proper access, and that is the reason they are going to any extent.”

Minutes before he died, Naik had sent out a message on a WhatsApp group announcing his intention to take the drastic step. Referring to the message, Dhavalikar said there was need to investigate as to whether it was Naik who posted the message, or somebody else.

Dhavalikar said there should be an inquiry into Naik leaving MGP, and the two MGP and 10 Congress MLAs who quit their respective parties to join BJP. “They left the parties only because they were not able to carry out development or they were promised that their land would be converted,” he said.

Naik had contested the 2017 assembly elections on the MGP ticket from Santa Cruz constituency, but later quit the party.

The CM should conduct an inquiry into those who have applied for land conversion and at what stage the process has reached and then act against those people or else more murders will take place in Goa and the government will be blamed, he said.

Ponda: Dairy farmers in the state are considering intensifying their agitation over the hike in prices of cattle feed, after Goa Dairy administrators refused to budge on their demand for a rollback of the hike. Goa Dairy administrator Arvind Khuntkar on Monday said that the milk co-operative has sought government grants to reimburse the losses faced by its cattle feed plant at Mharvasaddo-Usgao in Ponda. Goa Dairy had raised the rates of cattle feed by Rs 4 per kg from Thursday.

The agitating farmers have demanded a similar hike— of Rs 3 per litre— in milk procurement rates.

The farmers have been staging a sit-in outside the dairy since Friday, with heavy police presence.

The co-operative blamed their losses on the increase in prices of some ingredients used to prepare the cattle feed, as they have been brought under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST). It added that its feed was much cheaper than the feed provided by other milk unions.

While the Goa Dairy's high-protein cattle feed would now cost Rs 23.3, high-energy feed will cost Rs 23.8 a kg. The animal pregnancy ration will now cost Rs 21.5 and calf ration, Rs 25.5 per kg.

344,['21/01/2020'],New policy to sort out tax issues between industries and local bodies,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Bengaluru: In a move to end the constant tussle on taxation between industries and civic agencies, including urban and rural local bodies, the government said it will soon introduce a uniform taxation policy.

""We are holding discussions with the urban development and rural development and panchayat raj ministries to finalise rules. It will be tabled before the cabinet for approval soon,"" industries minister Jagadish Shettar told TOI before leaving for Davos to participate in the World Economic Forum.

For years now, industries have been accusing local bodies of levying ""unreasonable"" taxes, which they say is a violation of rules. Industries say local bodies are demanding tax even before industrial layouts are developed by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) and handed over to local bodies.

As per rules, layouts, whether residential or industrial, should be handed over to the respective local body, which, besides maintaining it, should provide water, power supply and other infrastructure. ""Only after that they [local bodies] are can collect tax,"" said a senior official from the industries department.

However, a former mayor of a city municipal corporation in North Karnataka accused the KIADB of ""intentionally delaying"" handing over layouts after utility services were installed by local bodies. The former mayor said this has allowed industries to function without paying tax.

""If local bodies supply water, electricity and provide other infrastructure, industries are bound to pay tax,"" said the former mayor. ""But because the KIADB takes it owns sweet time, industries avoid paying tax which is hurting the financial health of local bodies.""

This tussle has led to industries knocking on the doors of courts, resulting in tax dues piling up. Besides this, there is also the issue of different tax slabs being devised by different local bodies — much to the discomfiture of industries.

""The new policy will address all these issues,"" Shettar said. ""There will be a uniform rate applicable to all urban local bodies.""

Under the new policy, sources say, industries will have to pay tax dues of the previous year from the date of implementation of the new policy. The government will also ask KIADB to share 50% cess it collects from industries with local bodies till it officially hands over the layout.

Madurai: Kanyakumari district police have sought 28 days custody of A Abdul Sameem of Thiruvithancode and M Thoufiq of Elankadai near Nagercoil who were arrested for allegedly murdering special sub-inspector (SSI) of police, Wilson . The principal district and sessions judge (PDJ) who heard arguments on both sides said they will deliver the verdict on Tuesday afternoon.

On Monday, Sameem and Thoufiq were escorted from the Palayamkottai prison and produced before PDJ S Arulmurugan amidst heavy police security. Police sought 28 days custody of the duo for interrogation. Public prosecutor Gnanasekar argued that the police needed the time for extracting lot of information from the duo.

This includes getting information on where they hid the gun and knife used in the murder which are yet to be recovered and vital information regarding their terror links. However, counsels appearing for Sameem and Thoufiq said the court should not grant permission for police custody as the duo are facing serious threat to their lives from the police.

After listening to arguments from both sides, the judge posted the matter for Tuesday. The duo was then escorted back to the Palayamkottai prison.

Meanwhile, Thoufiq’s mother Y Jennath told reporters outside the court that her son was purposely framed in the murder. Claiming that her son is innocent, she added that he got married only 10 months ago and that his marital life has been ruined because of the police. His wife is in the eight month of pregnancy.

Earlier in the day, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court dismissed the habeas corpus petition (HCP) moved by Jennath that her son was not involved in this case and that he was kept in illegal custody and tortured. Accusing the police of harassing the family too, she expressed fears that the police might eliminate him in an encounter.

In her petition, she sought that her son be produced before the court and set him at liberty. When the petition was heard on Monday, the state government submitted that Thoufiq was arrested and remanded in connection with the murder of SSI Wilson, following which the division bench of justices T Raja and B Pugalendhi dismissed the petition.

Wilson was on duty at a Kaliyakkavilai check post in the inter-state boundary late on January 8 when two people murdered him by firing a few rounds and stabbing him. On January 14, the Karnataka police arrested the duo at the Udupi railway station in Udupi district, and handed them over to the Kanyakumari police. The duo was brought to Kanyakumari on January 16 and produced before the Kuzhithurai court. The court directed the duo to be lodged in the Palayamkottai Central Prison in judicial custody till Monday and to produce them before the court. Meanwhile, the duo was also booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Considering the sections and seriousness of the case was transferred to the PDJ court in Nagercoil.

NASHIK: The average wholesale price of onions at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Lasalgaon shot up by Rs 950 to touch Rs 4,400 per quintal on Monday. The average wholesale onion price was Rs 3,450 quintal on Friday.

Sources in the APMC attribute the increase in the average wholesale onion price to the rise in demand compared to the supply.

In retail markets, good quality onions are being sold between Rs 40 to Rs 50 per kg. The sudden rise in average wholesale onion price is likely to reflect in wholesale markets in a day or two.

The minimum and maximum prices of onions at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 1,600 and Rs 4,853 per quintal respectively. Around 15,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday.

“The unseasonal rain last year had damaged 75% of the kharif onions. However, late kharif onions have been cultivated in around 45,000 hectare area in the district. The harvest of late kharif onions has begun. Both kharif and late kharif onions are arriving in the market,” ssaid sources in the APMC.

The wholesale price of onions has been fluctuating since the past two months.

The average wholesale onion price had recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 last year. However, the price had plummetted by 40% in just a week.

According to APMC officials, the price of onions would remain on the lower side notwithstanding the average wholesale price which shot up to Rs 4,500 in just a day. “We are expecting the average wholesale onion price to drop below Rs 3,000 per quintal in the next three to four days,” said the officials.

Panaji: Goa University (GU) faculty and students worked on as many as 44 sponsored research projects in the academic year 2018-19, receiving funding of Rs 1.98 crore for the work. The university also received Rs 8.79 lakh for working on five consultancy projects, it told the Union human resource development ministry in its submission for the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2020.

The 2019 NIRF saw GU placed at no. 98.

When the ranking began in 2016, GU was ranked 20. As more universities entered the race in 2017, GU slid to the 64th spot. In 2018, it dropped to 68, but managed to retain its position as one of the 75 best universities.

The university has written to the HRD ministry stating that the ranking criteria is skewed in favour of bigger universities as the comparison is purely quantitative, and not based on average of faculty available, funds, outcome, etc.

In its submission for NIRF 2020, it said that during the academic year 2018-19, it had 1,556 students in various two-year postgraduate programmes. Of these, 1,122 were women. GU also stated that there were 105 students from outside Goa, and 19 foreign ones. GU has said that more than 80% of its buildings have ramps or lifts and specially-designed toilets for physically-challenged students.

Five of the university’s faculty members received different state and national awards 2018-19. Also, during 2018-19, 659 students graduated within the minimum stipulated time. Altogether, 408 students were selected for higher education and 65 found placement, the university said.

Madurai: It was K Kannan, a coconut tree climber, who taught the basic bull taming lessons to his sons K Rajithkumar and K Ramkumar, who emerged the best bull tamers consecutively in 2019 and 2020 in Alanganallur, their native village. However, Kannan, who himself a bull tamer, and his wife K Sundari do not approve of their sons participating in risky jallikattu events. Ranjithkumar got married only six months ago and his wife too does not like him taking part in jallikattu events, but it did not stop him from entering the arena . While he became the talk of the town for his scintillating performance, he got only scolding from his mother, he said.

Ranjithkumar, 24, and his younger brother Ramkumar, 22, have been training with bulls ever since they entered teenage. They would stealthily leave the house to take part in the events before their parents wake up. They would use the excuse of taking their bulls to the events, as they raise two bulls namely Karuppu and Vellaiyan, which are Umbalacherri and Theni Malaimadu breeds. Karuppu was among one of the bulls that won prizes in Alanganallur jallikattu this year. Ramkumar tamed 15 bulls and emerged winner last year to bag a car. Ranjithkumar tamed 16 bulls this year and won the first prize, again a car. He received a symbolic key from chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Chennai. When Ranjithkumar entered the ring in the last batch around 3.30 pm, just one hour before the closing time, little did the crowd know that he was the one, who is going to emerge as the winner. M Karthick from Ayuthanpatti, who had already spent quite some time in the ring, was clearly going ahead. Taming 16 bulls in just one round is unprecedented. But Ranjithkumar made it possible utilising the 30-minute extension allowed by the committee. “Prize not a big factor to emerge as winner. I just wanted to tame every bull and to make my village proud. Although there was a close competition with another tamer, I did not count the bulls. I just wanted to tame tougher bulls and earn appreciation,” he said.

His parents always wanted Ranjithkumar to find a government job. Unlike his younger sibling, who studied only up to 10th standard, he has completed diploma in electrical engineering. He is taking up odd jobs as a daily wager. “I asked the revenue minister to give me a government job as a reward of my performance. He said that he will look into it,” he said. Ramkumar sold his car and purchased the bulls using the money. He cited lack of parking space in his small house as a reason for buying bulls. “I work in a saw mill and earn Rs 7,000 a month, which is only enough to take care of my bulls. I always wanted to own bulls, since we see them as god in our village,” he said.

Panaji: The National Population Register ( NPR ) survey will take place in Goa from April 16 to May 30, while the houselisting survey of Census 2021 will be from February 9 to 28.

“In Goa, there are many Portuguese passport holders and other foreigners living. If they do not have an Indian passport, they can say so. Enumerators will not insist on any of this information or any documents to support these details,” officials of the Goa office of the directorate of census operations said.

Details of Aadhaar, passport number, voter ID and driving licence will be mandatory if you possess these documents, officials said.

While some of the details, like date and place of birth of parents, mother tongue, last place of residence, passport number, voter ID card number and driving licence number, are being sought for the first time, there will be no need to furnish documents to support this information, officials said.

Data collected from the houselisting survey will serve as a broad guideline for the actual Census 2021.

“Enumerators will visit a house up to three times, if it is found locked,” they said.

Officials said at least 3,000 enumerators and 500 supervisors will be trained for the survey and during the 45-day period of the survey, all households in Goa will be covered.

Last Friday, census officials from states and Union territories, including Goa, attended a meeting in Delhi to discuss the the NPR survey and the methods to conduct it.

A state-level coordination committee headed by the chief secretary will hold a meeting this month-end to plan the survey work. Training will be held for collectors, deputy collectors and mamlatdars during the second week of February.

They will then act as master trainers and will train 47 field trainers who will then train the enumerators, mainly primary school teachers.

The houselisting survey will also see enumerators asking details of facilities available in the household, like the number of rooms, main source of drinking water, main source of lighting, access to toilet, if the bathing facility is attached to the house, fuel used for cooking, availability of assets like television, internet, laptop, mobile phone and vehicles among others.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC), which plans to develop five petrol pumps across the state, will lease them out. It has already built one petrol pump at Pernem, which is ready for operation.

While it had initially decided to appoint a service provider to help operate and maintain the facilities, GTDC members opposed the idea of the corporation operating the petrol pumps. “A majority of the board members felt that GTDC shouldn’t take up the responsibility of operating petrol pumps,” a board member said.

“Who will account for fuel leakage and pilferage if GTDC starts operating the pumps,” the board member asked. Another member said it did not make sense for GTDC to take on the responsibility of running the petrol pumps when most of its residencies are in losses, and a major component of its expense is towards paying staff salaries.“GTDC will have to hire staff to work at the petrol pumps, and even if hired on contract-basis, surely there will be demands in future for regularisation of services, even if the pumps become economically unviable after a while,” he said.

The tourism department is already facing trouble with lifeguards even though it has appointed a lifeguarding service provider. The proposal to set up petrol stations was approved more than three years ago, in a bid to bolster GTDC’s falling economic health.

Madurai: A government school teacher and her daughter were stabbed by a teenager in a village near Usilampatti in Madurai district on Monday.

Police said the incident, which took place in Kokkudaiyanpatti village near Usilampatti, was a fallout of an enmity between the woman’s husband and the teenager.

The two were rushed to a nearby hospital with the help of relatives, from where they were shifted to a private hospital in Madurai. Police sources said the two are out of danger and responding to treatment.

According to police, Munipandi, a driver working with the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), reprimanded the 17-year-old boy, studying first year in a private college for consuming liquor near his house three days back.

It resulted in an ugly quarrel, resulting in Munipandi beating up the boy, hailing from the same village.

The teen came to Munipandi’s house armed with a knife with the intention of attacking him.

However, as Munipandi was not at home, the boy picked up a quarrel with his wife Kala and daughter Ananda Swetha and attacked them. As they screamed for help, relatives rushed to the house. But the boy managed to escape by then.

A police team from the Usilampatti Town station rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry. They also picked up the teen later and an inquiry was carried out with him.

Kala is working in the K Perumalpatti government school, while her daughter is studying third year in a city college.

Police sources said that the juvenile in conflict with law would be produced before the juvenile justice board and lodged in an observation home.

Madurai: The number of road fatalities in Madurai has come down by 15% in 2019 compared to its previous year, police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham has said.

Speaking after flagging off a rally to create sensitization on wearing helmet organized by the road transport department as part of the 31st Road Safety Week, the commissioner said the number of road deaths is coming down in the city due to increased percentage of people wearing helmet after the intensive awareness created by various agencies including the city police. Police sources said that while 232 road deaths took place in 2016, it has been coming down every year since then. It is for the first time the number of accidents has come down to less than 200 mark.

Devasirvatham said the city police has set an ambitious target of bringing down the road fatality by 50% in 2020 compared to 2019. Most deaths in road accidents take place due to head injury, which can be reduced if all the motorists comply with the helmet rule, he added.

A large number of public, men and women police personnel from the city unit took part in the rally, which started at Thamukkam. It ended at Palanganatham junction after passing through Anna Statue, South Veli Street, Crime Branch, Madura College and Subramaniyapuram police station junction.

Madurai district collector, T G Vinay, deputy commissioner of law and order E Karthick, deputy commissioner of traffic K Sugumaran, joint commissioner of transport Ravichandran, road transport officers Selvam , Suresh and Ponnurangam took part in the event.

Chhagan Bhujbal

NASHIK: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has dropped broad hints that he is not in favour of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) taking over the city bus service or being a stakeholder in the ambitious Nashik Metro project .

Bhujbal met mayor Satish Kulkarni on Monday evening to discuss various issues related to development projects in the city. The meeting lasted around 20 minutes.

“I reminded the mayor that financial condition of the civic body is not healthy. At this juncture, if NMC invests in projects like city bus service and Metro, it would add further pressure on NMC’s coffers,” Bhujbal said.

According to the guardian minister, he has suggested Kulkarni to seek advice from experts whether it would be feasible for the NMC to implement such projects that require huge investments.

These two projects were initiated during the regime of the erstwhile BJP-led government in the state. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had directed the NMC to take over the city bus service as MSRTC is not keen to continue rendering services within the city limits due to mounting losses.

Similarly, Fadvanis had announced the metro project for Nashik and Maha Metro has already prepared the DPR, which was approved by the previous state cabinet. The DPR was then submitted to the Centre for its final approval.

Bhujbal said there were discussions on other issues like cleanliness, mosquito eradication and garden development. “I am of the view that Nashik city should be clean and beautiful and NMC should ensure for this. It does not matter which party the mayor belongs to. I will support development of the city and not give any political label for the meeting with the mayor,” he said.

Meanwhile, Kulkarni urged Bhujbal to make efforts and get grants from the state government for the city bus service project.

“MSRTC was unwilling to run financially-troubled bus service and poor bus service was causing inconvenience to the citizens. Giving services to citizens is the first priority of the civic body. Hence, the NMC has decided to take over city bus service from MSRTC. The NMC will bear loss because of the service and we want the state government to compensate the losses,” Kulkarni said in a press release issued by the NMC.

“They tyre-based Nashik metro project is the first project in the country which is to be executed jointly by Centre and state. The total cost of the project is Rs 2,200 crore and the NMC as stakeholder will have to contribute Rs 102 crore. The NMC is already providing space for the project. Hence, state needs to reduce the burden of this additional amount on NMC,” the statement added.

354,['21/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Farmers reap benefits of farm ponds during low rainfall,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Though agricultural experts and the government have been advising farmers to create small farm ponds in their ... Read More

COIMBATORE: Unlike the rest of the district, Udumalpet did not receive heavy rainfall last year – just two spells of rainfall.

Under normal circumstances, wells and borewells go dry by January-end in Udumalpet.

But water can still be seen in R Raghunathan’s well, thanks to a large 80ftx80ft farm pond he created in August 2019.

A coconut farmer, Raghunathan is now confident that he can manage till the next southwest monsoon with the water available in the pond and the well.

Though agricultural experts and the government have been advising farmers to create small farm ponds in their lands for years, as an effective method of rainwater harvesting , it is only now that farmers in the Pollachi region seem to be experimenting with the idea.

“It not only holds the rainwater but also allows it to percolate into the soil, recharging the groundwater table in the area up to 1km radius,” Raghunathan says.

In the last two-and-half years, nearly 590 farmers between Kinathukidavu and Udumalpet, as part of Marico’s Kalpavriksha project, have either created farm ponds, bunds or trenches to save the rainwater that their land receives. “While at least 135 farmers from August 2018 have created farm ponds of different sizes, around 458 farmers have created trenches or bunds,” says Marico’s executive vice-president Udayraj Prabhu.

As per the project, 80% of the cost to create a pond is borne by Marico and the rest by the farmer.

It costs between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh based on its size to make a farm pond.

Though they don’t have numbers to prove improvement in groundwater table levels, farmers say the fact that their dry borewells have begun yielding water is proof that these ponds are serving their purpose.

S Subramani, a coconut farmer in Kinathukadavu , who created a 20ftx16ft farm pond in his land says he has drilled borewells twice and they have come dry even at beyond 100ft. “We have had to buy water to water my trees and then ended up cutting down many of them during the drought,” he says. “For the first time, I can see water standing in the pond and the borewell yielding water,” he adds.

“A farm pond does take away the cultivable space of at least seven to eight trees, but by giving up this space, we are saving more than 250 of our remaining trees,” says Gopalsamy, a farmer from Kolapatti.

Urdhvam and Bhungroo are the other initiatives being tried by farmers in the region.

While Bhungroo is a system where they inject harvested rainwater straight into an empty aquifer to store it and lifts it out for use during dry spells, Urdhvam is a system where they slit the casing of an existing borewell from the side, for enhancing higher water recharging in the borewell.

“However, Bhungroo is expensive, and water needs to be shared with nearby farmer. If they agree, the system works,” says Prabhu.

R Amritharaj, in whose land a Bhungroo was created as a pilot project, says he had previously dug borewells twice only to find them empty. “However, my 100-ft deep borewells are now yielding water due to the Bhungroo,” he adds.

The Tamil Nadu government has also launched a farm pond scheme, where farmers can get a 50% subsidy on their pond creation costs.

CHENNAI: Only 1% of passengers travelling in special class coaches on the metro actually buy the more expensive tickets, according to CMRL officials. In the past nine months, only some 9,600 special class tickets have been issued, but the coaches, which have cushioned red seats unlike the hard blue seats in the regular coaches, are often crowded.

“Nearly 99% of the people who travel in special class have ordinary class tickets. Of them, 50% to 70% are our own staff and police personnel while the rest are other commuters ,” a metro rail official said.

The comfort of cushioned seats comes at a premium. While the minimum fare in ordinary class is Rs 10 and the maximum Rs 70, a ride in special class costs double that.

CMRL numbers show that the service has gained traction over the past few months since the last leg of 45km phase-1 between Washermenpet and AG-DMS began operations in February 2019.

Between April and December 2019, around 9,617 people paid for special class tickets — 9,222 commuters purchasing tokens at the ticket counters in the stations while the rest had smartcards . “Most of our commuters in special class are one-time travellers,” an official said. Special class commuters get a gold coloured smartcard that looks different from the regular ones.

So, why are there no ticket checkers? Metro rail officials said though they have a separate ticket inspection team trained to use a handheld device to scan tokens and smartcards, they do not conduct surprise checks as they think it would discourage people from using the metro. Already patronage is lower than expected. The average daily ridership is 1.16 lakh for the 45km stretch against an earlier projection of 7.76 lakh.

“Our patronage is only now slowing increasing. Let people enjoy the ride and start using our service regularly. We do not want to stop people from using our service. Once our ridership goes up, we will have regular ticket checking. As of now, we have our train operators who, at times, step out of their cabin to check tickets,” said an official.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan will soon have its own goat milk dairy at Dooni in Tonk District that will be run exclusively by the women of nearby villages. The dairy has been branded as ‘AJA’ which means goat in Sanskrit, it will be run by the Matree Mahila Dairy & Agriculture Producer Company Ltd ( MMDAPC ) which has more than 1,000 women as its members.

This company contains a group of women who will collect the milk from the villages around them, bring them to the collection centre and from where it will be transported to the dairy where it will be processed. The scheme is looked after by Rajasthan Agricultural Competitiveness Project (RACP).

Project director of RACP and Rajasthan agriculture commissioner, Om Prakash, said that they have already received a grant of Rs 3.10 crore from the state government and the work will start very soon.

“Tender for the construction of the dairy will float very soon. We have provided the MMDAPC a 90% subsidy in opening the dairy. They will process the milk and will sell it in the market of Delhi, Jaipur and other prominent cities in Rajasthan,” said Om Prakash.

The project to venture in the production of the goat milk is going on since 2019 when the RACP organised the women in Rajasthan to sell goat milk and goat milk soap. A few months ago, milk and soaps were launched by RACP and are now available in shops situated at Gandhi Nagar, Jagatpura and Vaishali Nagar in Jaipur. But opening a dairy will enhance the capacity of milk production and the products.

Pritpal Singh Kalra, Project Coordinator (Livestock) at RACP said, “We are now utilising our goat milk share in the state properly. This dairy will process plain milk, flavoured milk, cheese, yogurt and ghee. Goat milk is nutritious, especially for children. In metro cities it is being sold at higher rates but here it would cost around Rs 35-Rs 50 per kg. At present it is being sold in bottles but in future we will sell it in tetra packs.”

At present, India is producing five million tonnes of goat milk every day. Goat milk has digestive elements, medium and small fatty acids and has components almost equivalent to human breast milk, which is why it is beneficial for children.

The existing jetty is 37m long and 8m wide. The proposal was to extend it to 140m length at Rs 20 crore

CHENNAI: Expansion of passenger boat services to Vivekananda Rock Memorial and Thiruvalluvar Statue in Kanyakumari might be delayed further as a proposal to expand the existing jetty to berth more passenger boats has been rejected. The Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority (TNSZMA) rejected Tamil Nadu Maritime Board’s proposal, which involved constructing groynes, citing a National Green Tribunal order.

The existing jetty is 37m long and 8m wide. The proposal was to extend it to 140m length at Rs 20 crore. Protective groynes (low wall or barriers) built using rubble mounds, tetrapod armor units and pre-cast concrete blocks were to be constructed throughout the length to protect the jetty from erosion and wave action.

While a ferry service operating from 8am to 4pm exists, most days and especially during tourist season and weekends, queue at the passenger boat ticket counter is over 1km long, according to official documents submitted with the proposal by TNMB. Everyday, at least 2,000 people don’t get a chance to visit the famed tourist spots, shows TNMB data.

Following this, TNMB and Indian Ports Association proposed to resolve the issue by extending passenger jetty so that two more vessels can be berthed, increasing the number of ferry services. “If the proposal materializes, more people will get to visit the rock without waiting for a long time,” TNMB sources said.

The proposed project falls in Coastal Regulatory Zone-IB (intertidal zone) and CRZ-IV (water bodies influenced by tides) areas. CRZ Notification 2011 prohibits alteration of landscape in such areas for entertainment, recreation and beautification activities.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT), in 2013, had directed the state government not to construct groynes or sea walls along the Tamil Nadu coastline without preparing a Comprehensive Shoreline Protection Management Plan (CSPMP). This plan, prepared with the help of experts from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, is pending for approval by the Union environment and forest ministry.

Citing the lapse, the TNSCMA in November last put a stopper on TNMB’s request to expand the jetty. It had asked the maritime board to instead study the feasibility of expansion without formation of groynes.

BICHOLIM: Mayem locals are irked about the rising instances of cylinder thefts that have occurred over the past few months.

With nearly 15 cases of empty cylinders being stolen from Gaonkarwada and Ardhawada, the villagers claim that a gang of thieves is at work.

Since cylinder refill services are offered just once a week, many office-going residents keep their empty cylinders outside their houses. The suppliers, however, said they did not find any empty cylinders. Later it was found that the empty cylinders were being stolen.

Madurai: Daniel Chellappa J, senior scientist, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), has urged engineering students to try to become entrepreneurs using and inventing technology for development rather than settle in big companies. He was speaking at ‘Technological empowerment of budding entrepreneurs’, a programme organized by the Rotary Club of Madurai Meenakshi being held at the Solamalai College of Engineering.

“There are better options available for students to settle for in their life other than getting placed in reputed companies. They can generate revenue easily even in lakhs through entrepreneurship. Their concept should be technically viable and economically feasible,” he said.

Chellappa further demonstrated how a regular RO filter works with electricity and later explained a new project, ‘Ultra filtration B Nova water purification,’ for which, no electricity needs to be used to filter water. “We are getting resources of daily consumables through imported sources. Through soil resources available in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Odisha, we can repay our nation’s debt. Electricity can be produced using these soil resources,” he said.

The participating students were sensitized about various schemes and resources available for budding entrepreneurs, including the district industries centre (DIC), which aims to offer services and support to all medium and small Enterprises (MSMEs), under a single roof.

Pre-final year and final year students of both engineering and polytechnic colleges from across the district took part in the programme.

Bicholim: Demanding that their pending water bills be settled first, Shirgao villagers on Monday halted vehicles transporting ore through the village.

With majority of their wells having run dry due to mining activities, residents are wholly dependent on water supplied by the public works department (PWD). Since the last several years, the water bills were paid by the mining company.

During the last two years, however, the company stopped paying the bills stating that no mining work is being undertaken.

Villagers have received notices from the PWD threatening that their water connections would be cut.

On Monday, furious at seeing trucks transporting ore from the mines, a large number of villagers, especially women, gathered on the road and halted the trucks. “We demand that the mining company first settles the pending water bills,” Shirgao deputy sarpanch, Vijaya Mandrekar said.

Following the commotion, a special meeting of all the stakeholders was held at the office of deputy collector Sachin Desai. He later told reporters that for now, the PWD will not cut water connections of any villagers. In turn, transportation of ore will temporarily continue from Tuesday onwards.

365,['21/01/2020'],Sivaganga MCH to begin eye transplant procedures soon,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Madurai: ‘Hospital Cornea Retrieval Program’, an eye donation initiative organized by the Government Sivaganga Medical College Hospital (GSMCH) in association with Aravind Eye Hospitals (AEH), Madurai, was inaugurated on Monday.

A human eye can be donated if it is removed within six hours after a person’s death. “Initially, GSMCH will donate the eyes for transplantation and the procedure will be performed at AEH. Within a few months, the procedure will be done at GSMCH itself. We will train a team of doctors for the process and the infrastructure required would be set up here itself by then and only the processing of the eye will be done by AEH, free of cost,” explained dean of GSMCH, Dr A Rathinavel.

Many organ donations and transplants, like the kidney, require an organisational structure at the state level, but eye donations and transplants involve a simpler process. “In this case, since we can remove the eye only from a dead person, all we need is consent from the patient’s kin. This can be managed at the institutional level. We’ve reached out to local groups,” said Rathinavel.

On Monday, Dr N Venkatesh Prajna, opthalmology director, Aravind Eye Hospitals and Rathinavel inaugurated the programme at a special event held on the GSMCH campus. “We’re having public-private partnerships with many government medical colleges. We reached out to GSMCH especially because we want to help start corneal transplantation in Sivaganga as well. The first step is to create awareness,” said Prajna. A special helpline number (7598520007) for eye donation was also released for the public to contact.

366,['21/01/2020'],4 centres to serve Shivbhojan thali in district,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nashik: Shivbojan thali — the discounted food programme of the state government — will be available at three centres in the city and at one centre in Malegaon from January 26, a senior official from the district administration said.

The state government has decided to give food at a discounted rate and will give a subsidy of Rs 40 per thali to the vendor who can charge only Rs 10 for the food served between 12 noon and 2pm.

The food should be provided by a non-profit organization, a non-governmental organization or the ones run by the Mahila Bachat Gat so that there is no profiteering from the scheme and only genuine people get the benefit of the same.

Also, it has to be noted that the organization willing to served food should have its own property and not serve the food in public place.

Accordingly, the district administration has planned three places in the city — at district collectorate, Nashik Road and Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). In Malegaon, the food will be served in Malegaon Corporation area.

A district administration official said none of the government employees were allowed to benefit from the scheme as the beneficiary was necessarily expected to be from the economically weaker section.

While there are no major criteria set up by the government so far, the vendor has been asked to click the photo of the beneficiary who has been served the food. “The beneficiary has to produce a Below Poverty Line (BPL) card and get his picture clicked for benefitting from the scheme,” the official said.

He added that though food is to be distributed from January 26, formalities have to be completed before-hand.

Madurai: Thousands of school students across Madurai, especially between Classes VIII and XII, tuned in to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi interact with school students across India at this year’s ‘Pariksha pe charcha’ in New Delhi. However, with most of the content spoken in Hindi and no subtitles or translation in Tamil, many schools had to turn to teachers and students who knew Hindi to translate.

Most schools in the city, barring a few private schools, screened Modi’s nearly two-hour long ‘Pariksha pe charcha’ programme using a projector or a computer. “When we started screening, we started getting concerned as students, especially those who don’t understand English well too, began showing disinterest. Luckily, we had a student who knew Hindi so she was asked to translate and explain,” said the principal of a corporation school.

Meanwhile, when asked if proper Hindi translators could have been appointed in the schools in advance, Madurai district chief educational officer, R Swaminathan said that so far no complaints were received. “It can’t be helped. However, I am sure students and teachers, who know Hindi, definitely would have pitched in to ensure everyone was able to listen and take in whatever our Prime Minister spoke about,” he said. On the other hand, students who were able to understand the programme, said that the PM’s speech was refreshing to listen to ahead of their exams.

Karti Chidambaram

CHENNAI: Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram ’s son Karti Chidambaram and wife have to appear before a special court for cases against MPs and MLAs on Tuesday, as the Madras high court has refused urgent hearing of their pleas challenging the prosecution initiated by the income tax department. The case pertains to non-disclosure of income to the tune of Rs 7 crore by the couple.

On Monday morning, when the high court commenced its proceedings, senior counsel Nalini Chidambaram made a mention before the first bench headed by the Chief Justice A P Sahi about the representation made to the registrar (judicial) on behalf of Karti. The CJ informed the senior counsel that the case would be listed before Justice M Sundar.

The senior counsel appeared before Justice Sundar post lunch and made a mention for urgent hearing of the plea, since the special court is scheduled to hear the matter on Tuesday. However, Justice Sundar refused any urgent hearing and made it clear that the plea would be taken up for hearing in due course.

According to the prosecution, Karti, his wife Srinidhi, and his mother Nalini Chidambaram had sold their lands at Muttukadu near Chennai to Agni Estates and Foundations Private Limited at Rs 4.25 crore an acre. However, the sale deed executed by the three was registered only for the guideline value of Rs 3 crore an acre and the remaining Rs 1.25 crore per acre was paid to them in cash. As such, Karti received Rs 6.38 crore and Srinidhi received Rs 1.35 crore, said the department.

As per the department’s complaint, Karti had not disclosed the receipt of cash components in their income tax return for the assessment year 2014-15 and Srinidhi in her return for 2015-16. The non-disclosure came to light during a joint search conducted by the I-T department and the Enforcement Directorate on December 1, 2015, in connection with the case of Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd.

On January 7, the special court dismissed a plea moved by the duo to discharge them from the case and directed their appearance on January 21 for framing charges.

369,['21/01/2020'],"Delhi: Legal tag to colonies matters, but access to basic necessities may weigh","Agricultural land has given way to colonies

NEW DELHI: “I can now get ownership rights of my house and it will help me get a loan if I need one,” smiled 60-year-old Gopal Das outside his imposing house in north Delhi’s Himgiri Enclave, one of the 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the city where conveyance deeds to their properties are being given to the residents. Das is grateful to Bharatiya Janata Party for fulfilling this long-pending wish.In the same breath, however, Das says that the Aam Aadmi Party has done a lot of work in the Burari assembly constituency, where Himgiri Enclave is located. “Two CCTV cameras have been installed in our lane by Delhi government and the road has been paved too. The MLA, Sanjeev Jha, is very accessible and tries his best to solve our problems,” Das testified.Himgiri Enclave is among the ‘better’ of the constituency’s unauthorised colonies. Burari is one of the bigger assembly constituencies not only in terms of area, but also the electorate. With 3.5 lakh voters, it is third largest constituency in Delhi. It has quite a few villages such as Burari, Mukandpur, Mukhmelpur and Jagatpur. While some areas are still agricultural, much of the farm lands have been urbanised or taken over by authorised colonies. Some like Himgiri Enclave and Harit Vihar have wide roads and kothis built on large plots, but the rest of the unauthorised colonies have poor drainage and sanitation and almost non-existent roads.“The road is being constructed,” said Awadesh Kumar, 50, a resident of Samta Vihar, pointing to the sludgy, undulating lane. “The area might look shabby, but it was much worse five years ago. A lot of development has taken place, including laying of sewer lines,” said Kumar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh but has been living in Burari for two decades.Sewage still overflows on to the lanes in Sant Nagar on Burari Road. The area is a hub of coaching institutes and offers students accommodation at low rates. “I have seen big hoardings telling us we will now get ownership rights to our houses,” said local Lalit Chauhan, 30, “but I’m not sure about the process because there is little clarity and no one from this locality has got registry of their holding.”So while regularisation of the unauthorised colony is cheering the people at election time, the ambiguities still bother them. Harit Vihar resident Ram Lakhan Vishwakarma confessed to being unsure of banks extending loans because his colony is still categorised as agricultural land in revenue records. “Regularisation of colonies will take time, but we have the basic necessities because AAP has done a lot of work here,” the 62-year-old said.The Burari constituency has a mix of people from different communities, most of them migrants. While BJP’s Shri Krishan won the seat in 2008, AAP’s Sanjeev Jha was victorious in both the 2013 and 2015.“There were huge farms here earlier, but this place is no longer a village. Agricultural land has given way to colonies and people from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Bihar are now in a majority,” said Karn Singh, 62, in Mukandpur Village. “Some development has taken place in the last few years,” he added. According to Yashoda Kumari, 29, a resident of Janta Vihar, another unauthorised colony, road construction had started in her area.Burari village’s Mahendra Singh, 40, however, is not so complacent. “Our electricity bills have not reduced,” he grumbled. “In any case, nothing is free because we end up paying taxes one way or another. I’m happy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has accomplished what no other leader before him did.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73466850,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206365,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/house-that-legal-tag-to-colonies-matters-but-access-to-basic-necessities-may-weigh/articleshow/73452656.cms

COIMBATORE: Walk into any coconut farm in Pollachi and you are greeted by the sight of bright green, yellow and red coconuts. However, a closer look at the leaves that have fallen on the ground reveals a white coating on them an unmistakable sign of whiteflies.

Coconut farmers, who had to cut down several trees during the drought season in 2017, said the flies pose a bigger threat to their livelihood now. The insects, which feed on the underside of coconut leaves, have brought down production by 50% to 75%.

The sap-feeding bugs, despite the bio-control methods advocated by the state government and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University , have been spreading rapidly in the district. The farmers knocked on every door in the last three months, seeking a remedy.

The bugs are especially attracted towards hybrid varieties, which most farmers prefer as they are short, said T Sakthivel, a member of the Vinayaka Coconut Producers Company , which has 2,500 farmers on board.

“Among the hybrid varieties, whiteflies seem to affect the red coconut varieties the most,” said Gopalsamy, who cultivates native tall varieties as well as the hybrid varieties. “The hybrid trees are heavily affected. I found all pesticides ineffective against the bugs,” he told TOI.

The farmers want the government to step in and save the rest of the trees. “In two years, coconut production has fallen by 75%. We don’t know how long it will take the bugs to destroy all the trees” said S Subramani. “Coconut production in the region will fall drastically if the government does not find solutions to eliminate the insects” the farmer said.

CHENNAI: A city accident claims tribunal held that the wife of a man who died during pendency of divorce proceedings is a legal heir and eligible for compensation.

The tribunal directed an insurance firm to pay Rs 86 lakh to the family of an engineer who was killed in a road accident in 2012. Of the total amount, the tribunal held that Rs 43 lakh is to be paid to the wife, though she did not move the tribunal seeking compensation and divorce proceedings were pending in family court at the time of the man’s death.

P Jayaraman of Ambattur and his daughter Premalatha moved the tribunal seeking compensation for the death of Jayaraman’s son, Vijayaraghavan. Vijayaraghavan, who was working as a senior engineer in an IT firm was riding his bike along Medavakkam-Perumbakkam Road when a rashly driven truck knocked his two-wheeler down. Jayaraman moved the tribunal seeking compensation and also included his late son’s wife as one of the respondents for proper adjudication.

The insurer of the truck, in response denied that the driver drove in a rash and negligent manner and stated that they are not liable to pay any compensation.

After perusing the oral submissions and documentary evidences, the tribunal held that the truck driver was responsible for the accident. On deciding the legal heir of the deceased, the tribunal noted that the legal heir certificate showed only the father’s name and neither the sister nor the wife’s name was mentioned.

“Since Vijayaraghavan died during pendency of the divorce proceedings before the family court, the divorce petition was dismissed. However, since divorce was not granted, the woman is still to be treated as wife and is entitled for compensation,” tribunal judge V Sudha held and added that the father and the wife of the deceased are entitled for loss of dependency while the married sister is entitled only for loss of love. The tribunal arrived at a compensation of Rs 86 lakh, of which the father and wife are eligible for Rs 42.8 lakh each and the sister Rs 40,000.

In his growing up years, Ranjeet Shinde would quaff a litre of buffalo milk every night. He needed it to build muscle mass not for body demos but to wrestle to the ground invaders with nifty touch-and-flee techniques in the rustic game of kabaddi.

Ranjeet knew even then that the milk he drank scored over cow milk in fats and proteins just as he knew how to toss a bale of hay, fill the right mix of cattle feed in troughs and tell a Murrah buffalo from a Jafarabadi from the shape of its horns.

Migrants from Kolhapur, the Shindes have been rearing buffaloes for milk over four generations. Ranjeet’s grandfather Ramchandra, who worked in the darbar of Shahu Maharaj , came to Pune with a lone buffalo, ‘Hira’, in 1918 and settled down in Somwar Peth which then quite resembled the village he had left in Kolhapur.

The numbers in the shed grew steadily and by 1955, the Shindes had shifted their herd to Kharadi. When the animal count was around 250 in 2010, the Shindes, by then a joint family, decided to split their holdings in the business. Accordingly, Ranjeet and older brother Amit, both in their early 40s now, got 35 buffaloes and moved out to their present 8-acre farm at Wadebolhai, around 18km from Kharadi.

The business expansion was swift. In less than a decade, the Shinde brothers now have 600 buffaloes — the most on any farm in and around Pune. This, even as their cousins from the joint family sold off their share of buffaloes because they were unable to cope with the rigours of the milk business. “The cycle of buying, selling, tending and rearing the animals has to be perfect. More importantly, one’s physical presence on the farm is necessary. Nothing can be controlled remotely,” says Amit.

So the brothers are wide-eyed at the farm even at 1.30am when the first of the two mechanised, bucket-milking sessions happens each day. When in search of buffaloes of good breeds, they travel distances up to 200km daily in the now-familiar villages of Haryana and Bhavnagar (Saurashtra).

The farm gets the best in cattle feed like cotton seed oil cakes, corn, wheat husk and dry sugarcane, all cut and ground in a branded foreign milling unit. The weighing and cooling process for the milk and the drinking water supply to the animals have been fully automated. Of the two trucks of dung generated each day, most is used for the biogas plant on the premises while neighbouring farmers line up for the rest.

Infusing such vitality into an otherwise dreary business has earned the Shinde brothers recognition and accolades at various farm exhibitions and from agricultural agencies. Some of their animals are meritorious in their own right, like the buffalo named ‘Maharani’ which won an award at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra exhibition at Baramati recently for giving a whopping 35 litres of milk in a day, which Ranjeet claims is a record in the state.

Ranjeet says the high-quality feed and care of the animals ensure that no buffalo gives less than 15 litres’ milk per day. Of the 3,000 litres of milk produced at the farm, 2,000 litres are delivered around the city while 1,000 litres go into making byproducts like paneer and curds. In the pipeline is also a plan to make quality mozzarella cheese.

A well-known ‘mastani’ manufacturer in the city primarily uses milk from the Shindes’ farm for its ice-cream because of the high fat content. Ditto for another sweets’ manufacturer with outlets spread across Pune.

The ‘kadhai’ with oil goes on the stove in the evenings at the Shindes’ sales outlet at Kharadi and techies from nearby IT companies shuffle in to savour ghee-laced ‘jalebis’ with milk. Watching the crowd, Ranjeet reminisces how the jalebi-milk combination used to be a favourite with the cauliflower-eared ‘pehelwans’ of Kolhapur, for whom energy in the ‘akhara’ mattered more than calorie count. An energy similar to what Ranjeet himself derived from the copious milk consumption of his youth, which powered his leaps at raiding kabaddi players’ legs.

4 lakh Warkaris from across the state seek the blessings of Sant Nivruttinath Maharaj

NASHIK: Over 4 lakh Warkaris from across the state today converged at Trimbakeshwar to seek the blessings of Sant Nivruttinath Maharaj .

The Warkaris, most of whom came on Sunday evening, took a bath at the ‘Kusahavarta’ (sacred pond) and then went to Nivruttinath Maharaj’s temple, where a special puja was performed around Sunday midnight.

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, along with his wife, performed a puja on Monday morning seeking blessings for the welfare of the state and the citizens. The Maharaj’s procession on a palkhi was the star attraction in the evening.

“The procession of the Maharaj is an important programme where the Maharaj is taken to Trimbakeshwar temple on a palki to greet Lord Shankar. When the Maharaj is paraded on the streets on a palki, people young and old queue up on both sides of the street to watch the procession and catch a glimpse of the Maharaj,” said Keshav Tungar, a resident of Trimbakeshwar.

It was only after the palki reached Trimbakeshwar temple did the Warkaris step inside the temple. “It is a tradition that Warkaris don’t visit Trimbakeshwar temple until Nivruttinath Maharaj palki doesn’t visit the temple on Ekadashi,” said Shankar Patil, a member of the palki.

The MSRTC had pressed into service 68 buses, which made more than 500 trips and trasnported 20,000 people between Nashik and Trimbakeshwar. “The bus service from Trimbakeshwar to various parts of the district and the cities across the state will continue till Tuesday evening,” said sources in the MSRTC.

Jaipur: Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi has constituted a coordination committee for the four Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry on Monday.

The move is being seen as a mechanism to address factional feud of leaders in the party, including that between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC president and deputy CM Sachin Pilot.

AICC general secretary (organization) K C Venugopal said the committees had been set up to ensure better coordination between the party and the government.

There were instances of government and party leadership having divergent views. Pilot has been quite vocal in his criticism of his own government handling over children’s death in Kota, local bodies elections and the government’s decision to allow non elected people for the post of chairman of local bodies.

The committee for Rajasthan comprises eight members. The committee comprises AICC general secretary incharge Avinash Pande, Gehlot, Pilot, former minister Hemaram Chaudhary, minister Master Bhawarlal Meghwal, former Speaker Deependera Singh Shekhawat, former minister and tribal leader Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya and minister Harish Chaudhary.

In the committee, the high command not only tried to balance the two camps – Gehlot and Pilot- but also ensure caste representation. Hemaram Chaudhary, Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya and Harish Chaudhary are said to belong to the camp of Gehlot while Master Bhawarlal Meghwal and Deependra Singh Shekhawat are said to be in the anti-Gehlot camp.

While Hemaram Chaudhary and Harish Chaudhary are from the Jat community, Malviya is a firebrand tribal leader from south Rajasthan. Deependra Singh Shekhawat belongs to the Rajput community while Meghwal represents dominant scheduled castes.

Students and activists participate in a protest against implementation of the Act

HYDERABAD: Slogans of ‘azaadi’ resonated at Dharna Chowk on Monday where hundreds of students from various educational institutions participated in a massive public meeting against CAA and NRC.

Organised by the Young India Coordination Committee, students joined protests supporting protesters in Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi, who have been on a sit-in protest against the CAA for the past one month. “Women protesting at Shaheen Bagh have set an example for the entire country. Their peaceful protest has made a huge impact,” said Mohammed Abbas , a student.

The protest had support from student unions of Maulana Azad National Urdu University, English and Foreign Languages University and other independent student bodies such as Students Federation of India, National Students Union of India and others. During the three-hour protest, people raised anti-government slogans and waved the Tricolour.

The protest was attended by actor Prakash Raj, who said the country instead needs a register of unemployed and uneducated people. “If they (BJP) want to make a register, they should make a register of the unemployed and those who could not secure education,” said Raj. Taking a dig at PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’ event held on Monday, he said people who don’t have a degree are seeking our documents and holding Pariksha pe Charcha,” said Raj.

HYDERABAD: A silent protest organised by students of Government Nizamia Tibbi College (Unani) was foiled by police on Monday. The silent gathering against CAA was scheduled between 5 pm and 8 pm, but the programme was stopped within an hour and the students were told to leave.

Meanwhile, activist and actor Prakash Raj who was to address the students, was turned away from Nayapul and several students were reportedly barred from entering the premises even after showing their identity cards. The students have been holding silent protests at the college for a fortnight now. “I was turned away from the college gate. The cops asked me who I was and why I wanted to get into the college. When I said I am a doctor and showed my ID card, I was told this is not college time and that I should go back,” said Sheik Mohammed , a final year student.

Students said that policemen were deployed at the college from 12.30 pm onwards and had created an intimidating atmosphere. “About 30 cops were on the campus by 12.30 pm and were stationed there throughout the day. We were holding a peaceful gathering. As soon as some of the student leaders went near the mike, the cops threatened us to disperse saying that it is a public meeting and they will take action against us. The students were forced to leave the gathering mid-way. Police presence in the college is intimidating and undemocratic. It feels like we are in a dictatorship,” said Zubair Alam , another student.

Even parents who had wanted to join the protest were told to go back from outside the gate. “While we were expecting atleast 500 people to participate, hardly 150 students could enter. Even then we could not have a peaceful gathering. We are scared,” said Arafat Raza, a final year student.

NASHIK: The mechanised cleanliness system started in Nashik division in the year 2017 for Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRTC ) buses and premises has now fizzled out as the organization does not have money to pay for the job.

All MSRTC buses in the division bore an unclean look as the onus of cleaning s on the state transport utility staff which the number of which is already lower than the required manpower.

“Shivshahi air-conditioned luxury buses looked attractive but today things have changed. Not only the external appearance of the bus has been damaged, but from inside as well the buses are not being kept tidy,” Vinita Chowgule, a frequent traveller between Nashik and Pune, said.

As the windows of AC buses are completely closed, the commuters tend to spit in the corners of the seats and this is affecting travelling by the MSRTC buses.

“The MSRTC though is not primarily to be blamed for the situation inside the buses as it is also the passengers job to maintain hygiene and cleanliness,” Nagesh Raut, another commuter, said.

The situation at the bus terminals is no different as blacks spots have started appearing in pockets. At this point in time Swachh Sarvekshan is being carried out in the city and all the government agencies have been asked to ensure the premises are kept clean.

The MSRTC, however, finds itself struggling to maintain the standards it has set when the mechanized cleaning of the platform was being carried out.

“Just a month ago we could see mechanized cleaning being carried out but all of them are now gone,” Ajiz Shaikh, resident of Wadala Naka, said.

A MSRTC official admitted that there were some issues over payment to the contractor for the cleaning job.

A senior MSRTC official said that the cleanliness contract was allocated centrally to a company which was responsible for washing the buses, platforms and MSRTC premises.

“Nashik division is facing financial crunch and we are unable to foot the cleaning bill to the contractor. Therefore, the contractor has stopped functioning from December-end,” the official said.

Bengaluru: Braving the biting cold, chief minister BS Yediyurappa took time out of his busy schedule to go around Davos on Monday.

Clad in a long coat over a suit, scarf and leather gloves, Yediyurappa, with secretary S Selvakumar in tow, took in the sights of well-laid bylanes, quaint houses and snow-covered pine trees. He also rode a cable car at Persenn.

A cook from Andhra Pradesh, who works at an Indian restaurant in Davos, served the CM shavige uppittu and khara pongal for breakfast. Yediyurappa had chapatis and rice for dinner.

Meanwhile, Karnataka is likely to have a ‘ Centre for Internet of Ethical Things ’, perhaps, the world’s first, which will seek to ensure ethical practices in trade and businesses, besides addressing issues like misuse of artificial intelligence, a concern that has been bothering business leaders across the globe.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Yediyurappa signed an informal agreement with Murat Sonmez, the forum’s managing director, on Monday. ""Investors around the globe are worried about unethical practices in business and a centre is the need of the hour,"" Sonmez was quoted as saying in a press release. ""If the Karnataka government is serious about securing investment, it should set up the centre immediately.""

Yediyurappa immediately responded to the suggestion by prompting Sonmez to write down an informal agreement on a sheet of paper which both signed. ""This centre will go a long way in Karnataka’s history of industrial development,"" Sonmez was quoted as saying in a release by the Karnataka delegation.

At the inauguration of Karnataka’s pavilion, Yediyurappa promised all support to investors. ""We are happy to be here and look forward to engage you on various development agenda,"" he said adding that he was keen to partner on certain strategic research that can help Karnataka become a major player on the global stage. ""With Karnataka emerging as a leading industrial state in India, we can make it a major player on the global stage,"" he said.

Industries minister Jagadish Shettar , chief secretary TM Vijaya Bhasker and industries secretary Ramana Reddy were also signatories to the informal agreement.

Panaji: The state government has failed to compensate all land owners whose land has been acquired by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for expansion of NH 66 at Colvale, Congress said here on Monday. The party also sought an inquiry into the quality of the highway construction, being done by M Venkata Rao Infra Pvt Ltd (MVR).

The party has served the government an eight-day ultimatum, threatening to launch an agitation if no action is taken.

“People should not be made to repeatedly go to government offices with all their documents looking for relief. There were shops, stores and hotels, with permissions from all departments. They paid fees for excise licences, panchayat permissions and trade licenses. Now, after their land has been taken, people have nothing. Who will compensate them?” Congress spokesperson Amarnath Panjikar said.

Congress claims to have found three cases where original land owners, or those with businesses, had not been compensated for their losses. One of these, Colvale-based Ramesh Salkar, claimed his entire liquor store was demolished without prior warning and that he is yet to receive any compensation.

Congress also alleged that MVR is not adhering to safety norms. “MVR is doing sub-standard work. Many have met with accidents and many have lost their land or homes because of the work. The PWD must check and ensure that work is streamlined and improved. Lights, signages and safety measures must be put in place,” Panjikar said.

Jaipur: With the organisers of Jaipur Literature Festival scouring the city for a new “home” from next year, Jalebi Chowk, hotel Clarks Amer, and JECC have come up as options. At an interactive session on Monday, Sanjoy Roy, managing director of Teamwork Arts, which organizes the event, said while JECC just cannot be an alternative given the character of the literary extravaganza, they have been suggested to look at Jalebi Chowk.

“Jelebi Chowk has come as suggestion,” he said attributing the offer to a senior official in the government but Roy is also weighing on options like hotel Clarks Amer, which currently hosts the evening music shows of the festival. “We have not finalized the venue as yet but looking at various options,” Roy said at the sideline of the event.

Senior officials at tourism department said while Jalebi Chowk cannot replace Diggi Palace, it can give some heritage look and feel but the road traffic could be an area of concern.

“If they can use the Ram Niwas Bagh parking lot having capacity for 500 vehicles, and run a shuttle service for a distance of about 2 km to Jalebi Chowk, the festival will retain the heritage quotient that it thrives on. The shuttle service can also allow visitors to see and enjoy the heritage of the Walled City area,” said the official.

Speaking on this year’s festival that starts from January 23, Roy said the economic slowdown made it difficult for them to organize the event. “At one point we thought of skipping the event this year,” Roy said highlighting how they tried hard to find sponsors. One should not be surprised if they come across signs of austerity.

Roy also talked about the impact of JLF on the tourism in the city. He said about 4 years ago, they had conducted a study to assess how much the city benefits from the visiting delegates and participants to the festival.

“We found that delegates and participants had spent about Rs 50 crore during the days of the festival. They used hotel rooms, bought jewellery, textiles, carpets, handicrafts, etc. Today, the figure could be more than double, more than Rs 100 crore,” added Roy.

Keeping in view the issues of security, traffic and concerns of the local people, the government and the organisers of JLF have decided to shift the festival from Diggi Palace to a new venue from next year.

CHENNAI: Censuring DMDK founder Vijayakanth for wasting the court’s time by filing unnecessary appeals seven years ago, the Madras high court dismissed as withdrawn one such appeal moved by him challenging refusal to quash criminal defamation complaints made by AIADMK government in 2011.

“Filing of such petitions and appeals unnecessarily consumes the time of the court and care should be taken in the preparation, drafting and presentation of such petitions and should not be brought forth unless there is any constitutional question, keeping in view of the nature of allegations that have been made. We hope and trust that such care shall be taken in future,” the first bench of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said on Monday.

The bench also informed the counsel for Vijayakanth that they are refraining from imposing cost as he had volunteered to withdraw the appeal. The criminal defamations were filed by the then AIADMK government led by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa against Vijayakanth when he was the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu state assembly.

Vijayakanth moved the high court in 2012 seeking to quash all such proceedings pending before the subordinate court. However, the same was dismissed by a single judge in the admission stage itself. Aggrieved, the petitioner moved the present appeal. In his affidavit, Vijayakanth submitted that his plea challenging the validity of Sections 500 and 501 (criminal defamation) was pending before a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court.

388,['21/01/2020'],JP Nadda’s elevation could be good news for Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa,"This story is from January 21, 2020

BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: For chief minister BS Yediyurappa , the BJP’s decision to hand JP Nadda a bigger role on the national stage is nothing short of a blessing in disguise.

Several senior party leaders are of the view that Nadda’s elevation as BJP national president will help Yediyurappa expedite the process of expanding his cabinet, which has been pending for more than a month now.

“Outgoing president Amit Shah was a busy man, handling dual responsibility of being party chief and Union home minister. So it was always hard for state leaders to get his time. Now, with Nadda taking over, it won’t be an issue,” a senior BJP functionary said.

Many feel Nadda’s good working relationship with the CM will alter equations in state politics and that he would take a decisive role in expanding Yediyurappa’s cabinet. He had played a crucial role in the formation of the BJP government in the state and had strongly backed Yediyurappa then. “Yediyurappa is leader of BJP’s Legislature Party and it is natural for him to be the party's choice for the chief minister’s post,” Nadda had said.

Nada’s elevation also opens up new possibilities for the state unit as he is known for his organisation skills. Top functionaries say he may frequent the state to ensure the state unit under Nalin Kumar Kateel takes up new programmes to strengthen the party.

Nadda also enjoys close ties with the Sangh Parivar and ABVP. “Our new president rose from the ranks of ABVP and so we expect to get more prominence,” said BJP spokesperson and former ABVP leader Anand AH.

However, some political analyst feel the change of guard will have no significant impact. “It makes no difference as the levers of control in the party will remain with the PM and home minister. While formal transfer of leadership in the party has happened, the de facto head for decision making will still be the ‘Big Two’,” said Sandeep Shashtri, a political analyst.

PM Narendra Modi

CHENNAI: “We completed all our homework and lessons on time because we were thrilled and excited to listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said P R Divyashree, a Class IX student at Government Girls Higher Secondary School , Ashok Nagar.

Divyashree, along with her classmates and 600 other children, assembled inside their school auditorium at 11am and were listening keenly to Modi’s interaction programme Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 with students from across the country and abroad, when he discussed with them ways to overcome and beat exam stress .

“There was pin drop silence in the room, for a change,” said P Mallika, assistant headmistress of the school.

Since the PM addressed the students in Hindi, a Hindi teacher was put on standby to translate everything he said to Tamil.

“The students were listening to him with such earnestness, I don’t think they needed any translation. They were responding to almost everything he said, even when most don’t know the language,” said Jeeva Rani, teacher at the T Nagar government school for girls.

Modi urged students to value time and learn to balance academics and extracurricular activities. He also said though they need decent marks and grades, it was important that they focus on other aspects of life and improve their personalities. The students cheered for the last statement.

But their takeaway was when he told them to use technology judiciously and not use it while spending time with families.

“We keep telling them this all the time, but they all nodded in agreement when the Prime Minister said it,” said Hemalatha Sivan, English teacher from Ashok Nagar government school.

A few students from the school had even registered to get a chance to hear the PM in person, but couldn’t make it. But that doesn’t seem to have broken their spirit. “We’ll apply again next year and I’m sure I’ll get to meet him then,” said P M Sandhya, a Class IX student. She had also prepared questions to ask him. “I want to know the rapport he shared with his teachers and what inspired him to serve our country. It was a great experience to hear him,” she said.

Jaipur: Muslim MLAs have asked CM Ashok Gehlot to bring a resolution against the CAA in the state assembly following pressure from protesters.

MLA Shafia Zubair from Ramgarh (Alwar), Wajib Ali from Nagar (Bharatpur), Amin Kagzi from Kishenpole (Jaipur) and Zahida Khan from Kaman (Bharatpur) have urged Gehlot to take a stand similar to Punjab and Kerala governments against the Act.

The latest to demand a resolution is Kagzi who shot a letter to Gehlot on Monday demanding a resolution against the CAA during the assembly session starting from January 24.

“I have apprised the CM about the sentiments of people from diverse faiths on the nefarious designs of the central government to divide the country. I have urged the CM to take a strong institutional stand against the CAA through the state assembly,” said Kagzi.

Kerala and Punjab have already announced to bring a resolution in their respective assemblies. First-time MLA Shafia Zubair feels that Rajasthan, which is on the fore fighting the fascist forces, should have taken the lead against the attack on the Constitution. “Gehlot has been upholding the ethos and values of the Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and BR Ambedkar. Needless to say that CAA, NPR or NRC will ever see the light of the day in Rajasthan,” said Zubair.

Ali, a graduate from Australia, was the first to pitch for the resolution in the assembly. A vocal critic of CAA, he has held protests in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago had asked the CM last week to protect the tarnishing of the Constitution by the fascist regime. “I would love to see Rajasthan leading the anti-CAA front,” said Ali, who was elected on a BSP ticket and merged with five other BSP MLAs into the Congress in Septemer 2019. MLA from Kaman (Bharatpur) Zahida Khan went to the extent of writing to Congress acting president Sonia Gandhi to ask all Congress and Congress allied ruled states to have a debate on the CAA and bring a resolution against it.

The state has eight Muslim MLAs in the assembly. They are all from the Congress, while the previous BJP regime led by Vasundhara Raje rule (2013-2018) had two Muslim MLAs from the saffron party. Interestingly, Congress MLAs have been toeing the party line on CAA but none other than the Muslim lawmakers of the party has demanded a resolution.

HYDERABAD: Several commuters on Monday complained that they were being forced to make cash transactions because their FASTags were not read by sensors at toll plazas. This is against a National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) notification which states that if the electronic toll mechanism fails to register the tag, the trip must be free.

FASTags were made mandatory from January 15. As per NHAI notification in 2018, vehicles are allowed to travel toll-free if machines fail to scan the tags. The notification states that if a person has a valid, functional FASTag with sufficient balance and is not able to pay user fee owing to malfunctioning of electronic toll collection infrastructure, then “the vehicle user shall be permitted to pass the fee plaza without payment of any user fee”.

Bala Vittal, who was returning to Hyderabad from Vijayawada, said, “The machine did not read the tag. After repeated attempts, I was asked to pay cash.” Vittal added he was unaware of the notification.

Kiran Babu, who was heading to Vijayawada, said he was made to move his vehicle back and forth so that the sensor could read the tag. “When the machine failed, I was asked to pay cash. When I refused they used the manual scanner which read the tag.”

Nishikant Panda, a resident of Bowenpally, who was travelling from Jhansi to Hyderabad, said, “At a toll plaza in Madhya Pradesh, the sensor didn’t read the tag and I paid by cash. Later, I got a message that the amount was deducted from my FASTag as well.”

395,['21/01/2020'],Schools step in as kids forget the art of reading clocks,"This story is from January 21, 2020

CHENNAI: As digital devices have made their way into homes and schools, children seem to be slowly forgetting the art of reading a clock. Several educators say they notice that a lot of children, including those in senior classes, have no idea about reading a clock or are struggling to do so.

Educators and psychologists pointed out that knowing to read an ‘ analogue ’ is a basic mathematical life skill and lack of this knowledge is concerning.

“By observing the minute and hour hands, children learn about passing of time and its value. It is a life skill that numbers that pop on digital screens do not provide,” Ganga Natarajan, principal of SAN Academy said. She recalled an incident where she saw a few 12 and 13-year-olds struggling to read the clock. “Because they are so accustomed to using a digital watch , they have little or no idea about the little hands and big hands in a clock. They feel it does not make any big difference, but it actually does,” she said.

The school now insists all students wear an analogue wrist watch and discourages the use of digital ones. And they are not alone.

At Vidya Mandir, a teacher found that a few students had trouble understanding the time left during exams as they struggled to read the analouge wall clock. “We have no digital clocks on campus, especially not in the exam hall, as a rule because it will help children have a spatial plan of time and complete accordingly,” said Shobha Raman, principal of Vidya Mandir.

T Gowri, parent of a 15-year-old, complained that she had to remove all analogue clocks from her house and replace it with digital ones since her son had difficulty reading time. “I even told this to the teacher but they paid no heed. They said my child does know to read the clock because everyone is taught the concept in primary school,” she said.

“But children will only learn to read clocks if they see it everyday. It should be practised,” said Revathy Parameswaran, principal of PS Senior Secondary school. Here, there are no rules against wearing digital or analogue watches. “We want our children to be exposed to both concepts. But at the same time, we teach them the importance and benefits of analouge watches ,” she said.

Neuropsychologist Dr B S Virudhagirinathan added that it lays the basic foundation of numerical learning such as differentiating ‘big’ from ‘small’, ‘less’ from ‘more’. “Since the clock shows time in multiples of five, children will learn numbers and fractions, which will sharpen their minds and improve developmental skills. It is crucial that teachers teach them well to read clocks.”

396,['21/01/2020'],Consumers ask Maharashtra for power tariff relief,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Representative image

NASHIK: Power consumers and representatives of consumer forums have decried the MSEDCL’s proposal to increase the power tariff stating that rather than putting in place efficient mechanism to collect the dues from defaulters, the state electricity board was trying to recover the revenue gap from consumers.

“Currently, the new state government is reconsidering the projects undertaken by the previous government. It should also reconsider the power tariff hike proposed by the Maharashtra Electricity Distribution Company Limited and also the decisions taken by the previous government in the power sector,” said Prataprao Hogade, a member of the forum of power consumers.

The previous government had assured the power consumers that the hike in power tariff would be slightly reduced but the MSEDCL did not budge from its decision. “This government should consider all the steps it can take to reduce the burden of higher power tariff on residential, agricultural and commercial consumers,” said Vilas Deole, another consumer activist from Nashik .

Proposing the increase in tariff— both in fixed charge and the tariff per unit—in the multi-year tariff proposal presented before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), the MSEDCL has claimed that the hike was in the range of 1-5%. However, consumer outfits claim that the MSEDCL’s proposal would take the power tariff up by 20% from the very first year.

There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration when it comes to the power tariff hike, as what appears to be a marginal rise is likely to have a huge impact in the long run.

“Take for instance, the average cost of supply (ACOS) is currently pegged at Rs 6.73 per unit. The MSEDCL expects it to grow to Rs 7.24 per unit in the 2020-21 fiscal and then to Rs 8.10 per unit in the 2024-25 fiscal,” said Siddharth Varma, a former representative of the forum of power consumers from Nashik at MERC.

Despite the Central government taking steps towards cleaner energy and proposing solar energy, the MSEDCL appeared to be neglecting the contribution of green energy and hence the rise in ACOS, said representatives adding that this would take the power tariff up by 12-35% for all consumers.

The consumer associations have called upon all consumers to write to the MERC against the proposed power tariff hike. MERC is going to conduct a hearing on the proposal presented by the MSEDCL.

Vasco/Panaji: A recording of a telephonic argument between Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) vice chairperson Reema Sonurlekar and urban development minister Milind Naik over the delegating of labourers to Naik’s home, went viral on social media on Monday.

In the audio clip, Naik is heard arguing, threatening and later apologising to Sonurlekar.

Sonurlekar and Naik, both members of the BJP, have denied leaking the clip on social media. Sonurlekar is part of the panel backed by Vasco MLA Carlos Alemida and Naik's panel is on the opposition, within the MMC. The power play between the two BJP factions has caused disturbances in the functioning of the council, say sources.

In the clip, Naik demands that Sonurlekar depute labourers to his home and is repeatedly heard stating that he is a minister and is thus entitled to seek workers from the council. Sonurlekar informs Naik about a staff shortage and the need for workers in other wards, and later offers to send four workers, to which Naik replies, “That is not my problem...” Stating that he should get as many labourers as he wants for the next six months, Naik warns her of “party-level problems”, to which she challenges him to “do what he wants”. Towards the end of the clip, Naik is heard apologising and requesting Sonurlekar not to object when the chief officer deputes labourers to his constituency. ""I had called her only to speak about labourers. She is a councillor, she cannot stop them,"" Naik told the media. Sonurlekar said, “MMC is short-staffed, the minister should understand this”.

“CM Sawant should take action against Naik,” said youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar, accusing Naik of disrespecting women.

It is suspected that the big cat was poisoned elsewhere by local residents as the region has recently witnessed cases of leopard attacks and its carcass was later dumped here.According to the forest officials, the leopard was a male, about two years old, and it is suspected that the big cat was either poisoned or was electrocuted due to illegal electric fencing around private farms in the region.Himanshu Bagri, divisional forest officer, western Terai region, said, “As the carcass was putrefied, the autopsy could not ascertain the exact cause of death. We have now sent the food consumed by the leopard, its liver, kidneys and viscera to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Bareilly for further examination.”Forest officials have ruled out poaching as the big cat was not fully grown and all its body parts – the teeth, claws and hide – are intact.“It seems that the leopard was fed poison-laced animal used as a bait by the villagers as there have been cases in the area where leopards have killed cattle and dogs of the farmers. The carcass packed in a plastic bag clearly indicates that the leopard was killed somewhere else and lately dumped here,” the DFO said.The forest officials have also filed a complaint against unidentified people under section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.In October 2019, three 'maneater' leopards were killed in Uttarakhand. One of them was killed by hunter Azhar Khand who works with a team of hunters led by Joy Hukil in Pauri Garhwal district. Joy had himself killed the other two ‘maneater’ leopards -- one in Pithoragarh on October 5 and other other in Pauri on October 30.Before that, four leopards were found dead on August 2 at the Rajaji Tiger Reserve and the Shivalik Forest Circle in Uttarakhand. The carcass of three leopards were found within one kilometre from the reserve. Two of the leopards found dead were females and one was male.According to a report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Uttarakhand is one of the worst state in terms of man-leopard conflict. According to a survey conducted in 2015, there are 706 leopards in the Himalayan state. Statistics suggests that nearly 300 humans have been killed in leopard attacks from 2000 till 2018.

Dehradun: Around 150 public buses which were purchased by the Uttarakhand Transport Corporation (UTC) in November last year are finally preparing to hit the state’s roads by next month after they finish a 15-day road trial.

Soon after the buses were delivered in November 2019, several of them were reported to have glitches while they were being tested by UTC drivers. Subsequently, a Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) team was called in to inspect the buses. The team in its report termed the buses as “faulty and unfit for active transportation.” Consequently, the buses were returned to the manufacturing company who was asked to send back the buses after modifications.

The modified buses were received last week by the corporation. Speaking to TOI, Ranvir Singh Chauhan, managing director of UTC, said, “The modified buses have been reviewed by our qualified drivers. They are being tested on the road for 15 days and thereafter, if all reports are okay, they will be brought into service.” When queried if the modifications have been carried out by the manufacturer as per their satisfaction, the official added that a minor technical snag was reported in one of the modified buses but it was fixed within an hour.

The buses have several features like panic buttons, broader seats, and CCTV cameras to give passengers a better travel experience. They also have a GPS system and fire detection alarm.

NEW DELHI: The arterial roads in central Delhi were choked on Monday afternoon owing to back-to-back roadshows, rallies and protest marches.While southeast Delhi is already under siege due to the closure of Kalindi Kunj road , traffic being diverted through Noida Link Road and DND Flyway was also stalled during peak hours. The worst impacted was Vikas Marg between 11am and 1pm.The snarls started around 1pm when supporters of Aam Aadmi Party gathered at Mandi House and Connaught Place Outer Circle for a protest march and a roadshow. Police shut one carriageway of Sikandra Road and a portion of Outer Circle from Minto Road for the rallies.As a result, traffic jams started building up on Sikandra Road, DDU Marg and Minto Road. The ripple effect of the jam reached ITO within an hour. Soon, police shut Outer Ring Road and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg for VIP movement from Talkatora Stadium to the BJP office on DDU Marg.Since ITO crossing had to be closed for 15 minutes for the VIPs to pass, the snarl reached Vikas Marg and Noida Link Road even as police tried to clear the vehicles accumulated on the stretch. “I was stuck on Vikas Marg for nearly 40 minutes around 3pm before I could reach ITO for work,” said Devika Bhalla, a resident of Noida.Commuters tweeted about the snarls tagging the traffic police. Police said they had to control the traffic signals manually.A senior police officer said that the increase in volume of traffic from Noida added to the mess. According to an estimate, there has been a 20% increase in the number of vehicles that earlier used the south Delhi stretches to enter the city from Noida. As a result, nearly 40,000 vehicles are added to the existing volume at ITO, which is the busiest intersection in the city.With the Kalindi Kunj road closed, motorists take Noida Link Road during peak hours to reach central and south Delhi to avoid the snarls on DND Flyway and Barapullah road.Construction activities at crucial intersections like Ashram and Bhairon Marg add to the chaos.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73475525,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275975,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/manic-monday-city-marches-to-a-halt/articleshow/73453230.cms

NASHIK: Teams of the Government Railway Police (GRP), Igatpuri, on Monday busted a three-member gang of mobile phone thieves that allegedly targeted passengers near doors of moving trains.

A total of 16 mobile phones worth Rs 2 lakh were recovered from the gang by the GRP teams, which had been tasked with the investigation following a spate of complaints registered at the police station here.

""A case of theft was registered at the Igatpuri GRP police station. The complainant alleged his mobile phone was stolen when he was sitting near the door of a coach,"" said Sudhir Patil, the assistant police inspector with the Igatpuri GRP. ""So we kept a close eye on that specific part of the trains. And ultimately caught a suspect on January 15.""

According to police officials, the suspect then named two others during interrogation. ""Sixteen mobile phones were recovered by the police,"" Patil said.

On January 13 Dhindori resident Tushar Pawar filed a complaint that stated his phone was taken while he was traveling on the Tapovan Express from Nashik to Mumbai. Pawar alleged that he dropped the phone when someone hit his hand hard as the train approached Igatpuri station. He said that since it was dark, he was not able to spot the thief.

The police, as part of the investigation, deployed personnel in plainclothes on the train. On January 15, a policeman in plainclothes was holding his phone out of the window on purpose when someone knocked him on his hand.

“Someone hit his hand hard. And that's when we realised that the suspects hid behind poles. The cops immediately got out of the train and rushed to the spot. The accused had started to run, but we managed to apprehend one of them."" Patil said.

All three suspects - Rahul Salve, 20; Lalit More, 22; and Vishal Atkari, 23 - are from Igatpuri taluka. The police said Salve already has six cases registered against him at the Igatpuri GRP police station.

MYSURU: In a unique development, mothers of students studying in primary and high schools in the district will come together to prepare lunch for their children for two days, on Tuesday and Wednesday, as midday meal workers have decided to participate in a two-day protest in Bengaluru.

Midday meal workers have decided to hold a protest at Freedom Park in Bengaluru on January 21 and 22 demanding minimum wages, job security, provident fund and ESI, Rs 3,000 pension and Rs 2 lakh lump sum after retirement among other demands.

Karnataka State Midday Meal Workers Federation district convener K G Somaraje Urs said that the midday meal workers will leave their villages on Monday (January 20) and will reach Bengaluru by train.

“We will participate in the two-day protest. Midday meal workers will have to bring or arrange their own blanket to sleep and food for two days. They will not prepare food for two days,” Urs said.

There are 5,206 midday meal workers in the district – 752 in HD Kote, 727 in Hunsur , 591 in KR Nagar, 621 in Mysuru taluk , 363 in Mysuru City North, 182 in Mysuru City South, 758 in Nanjangud, 623 in Periyapatna and 589 workers in T Narasipura taluk who play a key role in ensuring nutrition and education to more than two lakh children.

Meanwhile, the department of public instruction, in order to avoid any problems, had requested the children’s mothers, who are members of the Mother’s Committee, to prepare food for the children in their respective schools in the villages.

As per the Central government guidelines, the education department is supposed to form a ‘Mother's Committee’ in all schools. This committee comprises only parents who are motivated to attend school and observe the preparation and serving of meals, so that children feel a homely atmosphere.

Deputy director for public instruction (DDPI) Panduranga told TOI that the mothers will prepare food for the children till the workers return to their work from the protest.

“After we came to know about the protest, we asked the committees and villagers to support the department in preparing lunch for the children. They have agreed and so there will be no problem for the midday meal for children in the district,” he said.

DEHRADUN: The anganwadi workers, who have been protesting in Dehradun for nearly two months against low wages and other demands, were joined by former chief minister Harish Rawat on Monday.

The senior Congress leader joined agitators at city’s Dharna Sthal and sung songs along with them in protest. While the agitators appreciated his support, they added that their protest isn’t political in nature. “We respect his emotion but we would not like to say anything about political leaders showcasing their support. We are battling for our survival unlike them,” said Rekha Negi, president of anganwadi workers’ association.

At present, two anganwadi workers — Vidya Devi and Anju Chand — are sitting on hunger strike unto death to press for their demands.

Earlier, six anganwadi workers, who were sitting on a hunger strike, had been taken to Coronation Hospital by the police. The condition of three anganwadi workers among these six is worrisome, spokesperson of their association told TOI.

London: A 20-year-old Sikh student at Nottingham Trent University, who was assaulted on Saturday night in Nottingham city centre, England, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Nottinghamshire Police have now launched a murder investigation and suspect two people to be behind the crime.

“Police are trying to trace two men who fled the scene on foot,” a police spokesperson said. Police are questioning one person on suspicion of murder of Arjun Singh, who was rushed to the Queen’s Medical Centre following the attack, but died soon after.

“This was a serious assault which has resulted in a young man losing his life,” said detective inspector Richard Monk.

“Our thoughts are with Arjun’s family and friends and we would ask that people respect their privacy at this very sad and difficult time. We need to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage, including taxi drivers who were in the area of Long Row West and Angel Row at the time, or any mobile phone footage of the incident. It is really important that if anyone has any information, no matter how small it may be, they come forward immediately,” Monk added.

Pete Knowles, who delivers newspapers in the area, told a local newspaper that he saw an ambulance speed off as he was doing his delivery. “I saw someone on the floor, with a blue blanket over them. There were two ambulances that came and then police cars.”

London: Three Indian-origin Sikh men were knifed to death on the streets of Ilford in east London on Sunday evening in a drunken fight believed to be over unpaid work. Videos being circulated on social media show their bodies lying on the ground in large pools of blood, with personal belongings scattered around.

Emergency services were called to a “disturbance” in Elmstead Road, Seven Kings, a district of Ilford, at around 7.40pm. Police officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found three Sikh men, believed to be aged 22, 26 and 34, lying in different spots on the ground suffering from serious stab injuries.

A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: “We were called at 7.37pm to reports of a stabbing outside Seven Kings station in Ilford. We sent three ambulances, three medics in response cars, two critical care paramedics, two incident response officers and our hazardous areas response team. We also dispatched London’s Air Ambulance.” But despite the best efforts of the medics, the three men were pronounced dead at the scene.

By Monday 9am the Metropolitan Police had arrested two Sikh men, one aged 29 and one aged 39, on suspicion of murder.

According to news reports in local media, one man was stabbed in the neck, shoulder and chest, while another had been smashed in the head with a hammer. The men are all believed to be Indian migrant workers who had only been in the UK a few years. They worked in the construction industry.

A local man, Mr Pali, said: “The argument was all over money for unpaid work. That happens a lot around here because we have a lot of immigrants from India who work as builders.”

The Daily Mail identified two of the victims as Narinder Singh, 26, a construction worker, and his best friend Harinder Kumar , 22, both of whom have relatives in India. Harinder was originally from Patiala in Punjab, and had been living in London for eight years, most recently in Seven Kings. His brother-in-law, who lives in Patiala, told Mirror Online: “Honey was a very simple and religious guy. He can’t get involved in any quarrel.”

A Metropolitan Police spokesman told TOI: “At this stage we believe all three victims and the two men arrested are Sikh and we believe they were all known to each other. We do not yet know if they are British or Indian citizens.”

SAMASTIPUR/PATNA: Unidentified criminals looted over Rs 23 lakh and snatched the licensed gun of a security guard in two separate incidents in Samastipur and Darbhanga district on Monday.

In the first incident, the criminals looted over Rs13 lakh and the security guard’s gun from the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India office at Shahpur Patori in Samastipur district. In another incident, armed criminals looted Rs10 lakh from a customer service point incharge near Harauli under Kusheshwarsthan police station in Darbhanga district. SHO Manish Kumar said the incident took place around 4pm when the victim was returning to his office after withdrawing cash from a local bank.

The Samastipur incident took place around 1pm when the employees were busy in dealing with the customers. Police said over six criminals barged into the office and held the staff as well as the customers captive at gunpoint.

The robbers first snatched the gun from the security guard, Girish Deo Singh, after hitting him with revolver butts and then went to the branch manager Manoj Kumar’s chamber. They took the keys and collected Rs8.54 lakh from the locker and looted Rs4.69 lakh from the cash counter.

Locals said the robbers also snatched cash and mobile phones from a few customers before leaving with the booty. The victims told the police that the robbers had covered their faces with clothes and helmets.

The SP later told the media that a special investigation team (SIT) has been set up to solve the case at the earliest. “The borders of the district have been sealed and search operation was launched to nab the robbers,” he added.

Locals told the police that the criminals escaped towards the railway crossing on their motorbikes.

The CCTV grab showing the fishing cat

KONNAGAR: A fishing cat caught on a CCTV camera on Monday at Kanaipur of Hooghly’s Konnagar sparked panic among the locals after they mistook it for a tiger. The footage was scanned by the security staff of a local grille factory.

The security guards of the factory, along Delhi Road, started their shift with a routine scan of the previous night’s CCTV footage on and around the premises. While doing so, they were stunned to discover a ‘tiger-like’ animal walking past a goods carrier parked outside the factory.

Soon, word about a “a tiger on the prowl” in the area spread. The panicked factory workers and locals started looking for the animal. The forest department, local panchayat office and Uttarpara police were informed. Panchayat pradhan Acchelal Yadav and Uttarpara IC Suprakash Patnaik arrived at the spot and appealed to the people to remain calm.

“We even sent out a team that went around Kanaipur with a microphone and urged the people not to panic,” said Yadav.

Munna Ray, a factory worker, said, “Earlier, we spotted pug marks on the fields in the area. Looking at the CCTV footage, we were absolutely sure that a tiger was roaming in the area.”

Chandernagore police commissioner Humayun Kabir said, “The forest department has been informed. The animal in the CCTV footage was a fishing cat, which is yet to be caught. We are trying to ensure that people don’t kill the animal.”

State forest minister Rajib Banerjee, too, confirmed that the animal was indeed a fishing cat and not a tiger.

416,['21/01/2020'],10% property tax rebate for adopting eco-friendly processes,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) general body on Monday approved rebate of 10% in property tax for houses adopting at least two of four eco-friendly projects — producing compost by garbage segregation, rainwater harvesting, wastewater treatment and reuse, and producing solar or any type of renewable power. Also, approval has been given for 50% rebate in property tax where persons with disabilities reside.

NMC has become the first municipal corporation in the state to launch rebate for producing compost by garbage segregation, wastewater treatment and reuse, and persons with disabilities.

From April 1, 2015, NMC has been giving rebate of 5% for houses having solar power system or rainwater harvesting system. But the rebate is on general tax, one of the components in property tax. The rebate was very low and failed to encourage people to adopt eco-friendly projects.

Now, the civic body has changed the system and launched rebate system on entire property tax, excluding three components of state government, which are minimal in total property tax. Also, NMC has included producing compost by garbage segregation and wastewater treatment and reuse. The taxpayer will be eligible for 5% rebate for adopting only one of the four eco-friendly projects.

The civic body has miserably failed to encourage garbage segregation and reuse of wet waste at households itself, which led to this rebate offer.

Taxpayers can avail the rebate only if they pay property tax regularly. The taxpayer will have to declare eco-friendly projects, after which tax inspector or assistant engineer from zone will inspect and certify it every year.

A NMC official told TOI this will be implemented from fiscal 2020-21, which begins from April 1, 2020. “Demand notes for current fiscal have been distributed. Also, the department will have to change the format in the systems,” he said.

The decision to give 50% rebate in property tax for persons with disabilities will be submitted to the state government before implementation. The benefit will be given in case any one member of the family has certificate issued by civil surgeon.

Earlier, NMC had decided to give rebate to senior citizens. But in this case, the owner of the building should be a senior citizen.

The general body has also approved a proposal to establish a plant to treat 200 metric tonne (MT) mixed garbage at Bhandewadi dumping yard on DFBOOT basis. The private operator will be leased 4 acres to develop a plant at its cost, operate and maintain for 15 years.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said, “This plant will ensure scientific disposal of entire city’s mixed garbage. NMC has proposed various projects to reuse the segregated garbage. Plant will be closed down if 100% garbage segregation is achieved.”

417,['21/01/2020'],"Sudden transfer of justice Haq ‘shocking’, lawyers protest","This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: A week after Bombay high court chief justice (CJ) Pradeep Nandrajog transferred justice Zaka Haq from Nagpur to Aurangabad without assigning any reason, some lawyers have protested the move terming it “shocking”.

They’ve requisitioned the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) to immediately convene a meeting to condemn the development. The District Bar Association (DBA) too has supported the lawyers’ move.

According to them, its “injustice” to city judges. For the second time in recent past, they have been shifted out after passing several verdicts against the government and judicial officers. Earlier, justice (retired) Arun Chaudhari was transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

The HCBA office-bearers agreed to discuss the resolution moved by top lawyers which includes former advocate general Shreehari Aney, Mukesh Samarth, Shreerang Bhandarkar, Ravi Sanyal, Neeraj Khandewale and DBA president Kamal Satuja among others.

“A general body meeting has been convened at 1.45pm on Tuesday to discuss the resolution,” vice president Purushottam Patil told TOI.

On January 13, the CJ transferred justice NB Suryawanshi (from Mumbai) along with Haq. While Haq will have Aurangabad as his headquarters, for Suryawanshi it will be Nagpur. The new order comes into effect from February 1.

Bhandarkar and some others have called for a total boycott of working in courts. Senior counsel Aney felt that a boycott call would amount to interference in the judiciary. “Even though a resolution was mooted by the HCBA members, it can’t boycott the HC’s working, as it would amount to contempt. Bar can’t interfere in the justice administration, it’s impermissible. Such actions can lead to obstruction of the justice,” he said.

While recalling an earlier such instance, Aney said the HCBA had proposed a resolution against late justice Ashok Desai for boycotting his court. “As president in the 1990s, I withheld an objection to this resolution. The bar can’t stop court’s working because it is dissatisfied with its actions,” he said.

Adding that the CJ has every right to transfer judges, Aney said, “If the members are concerned that his transfer is affecting court’s functioning, they can protest, but can’t stop HC’s functioning.”

Aney also flayed former CJ’s decision to transfer high-profile cases like of Sophia Power Plant in Amravati and alleged naxal kingpin GS Saibaba’s petition to principal seat in Mumbai.

In their resolution, the protesting lawyers stated that justice Haq was an illustrious member of the bar and had an extensive practice in the Nagpur bench before being elevated as a judge. “With unfortunate news of his transfer, the HCBA apprehend that this region would lose one of the most honest, upright and principled judge. The transfer is affected when he’s retiring in May 2021. Rumours are that the transfer is on a complaint by some lawyers. If it’s true then, the action appears to have been taken on the basis of the false complaint which may be motivated, and without verifying the truth,” they said.

The members demanded that Haq continue to be in Nagpur bench and resolved that the HCBA committee would deliver a representation of all lawyers to CJ for withdrawing the transfer orders immediately.

MUMBAI: Even as there is no word on the whereabouts of autistic teen Tarun Gupta over three months after he went missing from Colaba , his family could take hope from the fact that another autistic youngster missing from western suburbs was found within 24 hours.Trilok Kadam (12) had stepped out of his Borivli home with his football around 4.10pm on Sunday. By 10am on Monday, his parents received a phone call from Samta Nagar police station, Kandivli East, that he had been found with his football. It is a well-documented fact that children with autism have a tendency to wander. As Trilok does not speak, his family says they may never know how he landed four kilometres away, across a very busy Western Express Highway.Trilok’s family said they are happy and relieved that he is safe and unharmed. Trilok attends a school for children with special abilities and is always accompanied by his mother. On Sunday, she was unwell and taking rest when he took off the latch on the door and left home with his football. When he did not return, his family got worried and started to look for him. CCTV footage from the society showed him walking out around 4.12pm. Trilok was not wearing slippers and was not dressed for the cold at night.While his family registered a complaint with Borivli police, friends and relatives started a massive hunt for Trilok. They checked every corner of Borivli and posted Trilok’s photograph on social media and WhatsApp. The search parties only took a break at 3am before starting again at 4.30am as they knew Trilok would be hungry and might appear at food stalls that open early in the morning. By 10am, after having looked for Trilok for nearly 17 hours, the family received a call from Samta Nagar police. Police sent across his photo to his family to confirm. Apparently, locals had spotted Trilok wandering the streets in Kandivli East the previous day and had brought him to the police station.Samta Nagar police sent across a message to their counterparts at other police stations, including Borivli, where a search was already on for Trilok. “It appears the little boy walked down the stretch. He hasn’t suffered any injury and went home with his family around noon on Monday,” said a police officer.Tarun’s family has been waiting for news of him after he got separated from them on October 1, 2019. The family has offered Rs 2 lakh for any information on his whereabouts and has got 25 leads from Belapur, Virar, Thane, Sawantwadi and Pune, among others. On Sunday, at Tata Mumbai Marathon, posters and pamphlets were distributed by Tarun’s father and other parent-volunteers to highlight the search for the teen.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73460932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140906,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/missing-autistic-boy-traced-in-24-hours/articleshow/73446048.cms
420,['21/01/2020'],As India opts out of RCEP ice creams set to get dearer by 8%,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Chennai: Come summer, and everyone looks forward to having their most favourite dessert — ice-cream. Kids and adults alike enjoy licking their shares as the mercury rises. However, this season you may have to shell out more for your favourite cone.

With the industry seeing a shortage in milk supply by 10%-15% and India opting out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnerships (RCEP) — a proposed free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region between the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their five FTA partners — the availability of skimmed milk powder, a key ingredient in ice creams and dairy products, has dipped.

Opting out of the RCEP means fewer avenues for importing skimmed milk powder. The Indian Ice Cream Manufacturers Association (IICMA) says that coupled with low milk supply — caused by low availability of fodder, owing to irregular monsoons — and little room for imports, SMP prices have more than doubled from Rs 150/kg to Rs 330-Rs 360/kg.

Dealing with a shortage of the key ingredient, brands such as Amul, Vadilal, Mother Dairy are looking to increase the rates of ice creams by 5%-10% per unit or have already increased the prices. “This is potentially a dangerous situation and liquid milk prices have already been increased by dairies by 20% y-o-y and with summer coming up, as the supply falls, the prices are likely to see a Rs 5-Rs 8/per liter rise. SMP prices which are already hovering in the Rs 330+ range will further go up to Rs 360 or more. This will lead to retail prices of ice-cream and dairy products going up by 8%-10% — compared to last year,” said Rajesh Gandhi, president, IICMA. Gandhi, who is also the managing director of Vadilal Industries, says given the current price situation, by February, prices would be up by 5%-8% for their brand. “However, we cannot pass on the entire burden to the consumer. There will be a backlash and demand will drop,” he added.

Amul ice creams are costlier by 8% since the beginning of January 2020 and other milk products are up by 5%. RS Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Co-operaitve Milk Marketing Federation says that the price increase is because of the rising prices of sugar, along with the skimmed milk powder.

The supply of milk has also dropped by 10%-15%, industry players add. Chennai-based Gho Agro is also looking to increase the prices of paneer and curd by 5%-8% following the short supply. “We are considering an increase of around 5% in the next month given the drop in milk supply and we have to keep our margins intact,” said Vimal Chordia, co-founder, Gho Agro. To manage the situation, the IICMA has proposed the creation of a buffer stock of 65,000 metric tonnes, through imports, which would be used to stabilise market to maintain /reduce prices within acceptable levels.

However, Amul’s MD Sodhi adds that there is no need to import and the shortage in supply is temporary.

“The flush season — the time of the year when the increase in milk supply commences - which generally starts after Diwali — has already started in December for this season. We are getting 60 lakh litres more milk than the summer season and the situation will continue till April. The shortage in supply is not as bad to rely on imports or create a buffer. Besides, imports will hurt farmers which cannot be encouraged,” Sodhi said.

Amritsar: Pakistani Hindu girl Mehak Kumari (15), who was abducted, forcibly converted to Islam and married to a Muslim man, was recovered by police on Monday, five days after she had gone ‘missing.’

General secretary of All Pakistan Hindu Panchayat (APHP) Ravi Dawani told TOI on phone from Karachi on Monday that police had recovered Mehak from Ghariyasin town, about 100 kilometres from Jacobabad, in Sindh province. Mehak was abducted by 28-year-old Ali Raza Machi, who had earlier divorced his two wives and had four children. Machi reportedly forced Mehak to embrace Islam and married her at Dargah Amrote Sharif.

Dawani said Mehak was in police custody in Shikarpur district, which was a bordering district with Jacobabad. While hailing Jacobabad police and civil administration for helping the Hindu community for restoring confidence among them, he said police had also arrested Machi.

He said the accused would be produced in a local court on Tuesday. “We expect that she will be handed over to her family after completing legal formalities,” said the general secretary of APHP. Dawani said since the girl was minor, her conversion to Islam and marrying a Muslim man shouldn’t be accepted.

On the reports of abduction of another Pakistani Hindu girl Guddi Kumari, Dawani said, “We have been hearing reports of her abduction in news. Neither her parents, nor any other family member has come forward claiming her abduction. As of now, we can’t confirm her abduction.”

Rahul Gandhi

JAIPUR: Rahul Gandhi will kick off a series of anti-Modi rallies from Jaipur on January 28.

With students in universities up in arms against the Centre and youth disillusioned with the Modi government on the job front, the Congress is trying to use it as an opportunity to tap on the anger of the youth against the Modi dispensation.

Youths have been a staunch supporter of Modi who had garnered vote for development. But Modi’s second term has seen the party slipping on governance and focusing more on its Hindutva agenda with the people divided on the Citizens Amendment Act. The economy is also sliding and the Congress sees this as an opportunity to attack the Modi government.

Thus, the party had planned several outreach programmes by Rahul Gandhi.

Party sources confirmed that Rahul would kick off several public meetings from here on January 28. But the party has not yet decided on the venue of the meeting.

AICC general secretary incharge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande confirmed that Rahul’s meeting in Jaipur was not confined to support the anti-CAA protests. It will encompass wider issues including pressing ones like widespread unemployment, agriculture distress, atrocities against students and youths and national economic disaster.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot , while speaking on the visit of Rahul on Monday, said he is a youth leader and will articulate the concern of students and youth who are at the forefront of the fight against the anti-people policies of the NDA government.

423,['21/01/2020'],Maharashtra board may introduce 1 textbook for all subjects,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In an exercise to reduce the weight of schoolbags , the state’s textbook publishing bureau, Balbharti, has proposed to integrate all subjects into one textbook and split it into three or four parts for each semester.This way, students will have to carry just one of these textbooks for each semester. Balbharti will run the pilot in Marathi medium schools affiliated to the state board in 59 blocks across Maharashtra for classes I to VII from 2020-21 academic year.Balbharti has proposed textbooks for classes I to V will be divided into three parts and for classes VI and VII into four. “An integrated textbook for all subjects would mean students carry material required only for the stipulated time. Currently, each subject has a textbook and students have to carry all to school on the basis of timetable. Together, these textbooks add to the schoolbag weight. Hence, there were deliberations on how this could be changed and an integrated textbook was one solution. All the subjects would be combined into one textbook and then split into three or four parts. Students will then have to carry only one textbook, irrespective of the subjects on the timetable,” said a notice on Balbharti’s website. A similar format was introduced in Tamil Nadu in 2012-13. In Uttar Pradesh, Class I has just one textbook that includes three subjects and Class II has two.The bureau has called for suggestions from stakeholders over the next 20 days. Sample copies of three parts of a Class I textbook have been uploaded for review. The part one textbook, which combines four subjects, has 132 pages. Currently, students have three textbooks of 86 pages and one of 98. “Based on the results and feedback from the pilot, the government will implement the scheme across the state,” stated the letter. Ideally, a schoolbag’s weight should not exceed 10% of a student’s weight.Integrated textbooks were one of the 44 suggestions a state committee made in 2015. Swati Patil, who has an ongoing petition in Bombay high court on schoolbags, called the move “a step in the right direction”. Principals said it would help too. “We were pulled up if bag weight exceeded the limit when little was in our control as students had to carry books for all subjects,” said Prashant Redij of Hilda Convent High School, Kandivli.

Car crossed 3 lanes before hurtling off highway and landing in window of bus

MUMBAI: In a bizarre accident , a speeding car hurtled off the Western Express Highway and pierced through the window of a bus parked on the service road beneath, at Jogeshwari East, early on Monday. All three occupants of the car had a lucky escape, though they sustained injuries. Sarvesh Tawde (23), who was at the wheel of the car, was later arrested on charges of rash driving.

Tawde, a college student, lives at Bimbisar Nagar in Goregaon. The car belonged to one of his friends. “Tawde had a driving licence and often took the wheels whenever he and his friends went out for drives,” said a police officer. Late on Sunday, Tawde and two other collegians headed out for another drive.

The mishap was reported around 1.15am near Shankarwadi bus stop. Witnesses said the car must have been moving around 80kmph to 100kmph on the south-bound arm of WEH.

Tawde first hit a metal sheet installed for Metro construction work. He lost control and the car swerved left—crossing three lanes— before hurtling off the highway and landing in the window of a bus parked on the service road beneath. “The bus ended up cushioning the fall. Had the bus not been parked on the service road, the car would have landed directly on the road and the fall could have proved fatal for the occupants,” said a senior police officer.

As it was night, the bus was empty. Locals gathered at the spot after hearing a crashing sound and, with great difficulty, they extricated the three occupants from the car.

The trio was rushed to a public hospital where they were treated. Tawde was examined for the presence of alcohol in his blood but the test was negative.

“There could have been more casualties had the bus been occupied,”' said an officer. The bus operator, Albert D’Souza, later pressed charges against Tawde. “We have booked Tawde under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act,” said DCP Ankit Goyal.

Girish Bapat

PUNE: The city district Congress committee on Monday opposed MP Girish Bapat ’s demand for dissolution of cantonments across the country and their merger into municipal bodies.

In a press release issued on Monday, the committee threatened to launch an agitation if the BJP-led government at the Centre decided to go ahead with the plan.

“Pune city district Congress committee will oppose any move by the BJP-led government at the Centre to abolish cantonment boards, including Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road ,” the press release stated.

Senior BJP leader and MP Girish Bapat had said on Friday the cantonments were a remnant of the British era and were no longer relevant. He had also said during his maiden appearance at the general body meeting of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) that the civil areas of the cantonments should be merged with adjacent municipal corporations.

“In the past five years, the BJP-led government was at the helm of affairs at the Centre and the state. It had three MLAs representing Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road Cantonment Boards. Yet, the party could not secure development of the area. When the BJP-led government introduced the goods and services tax, the boards were promised their share of revenue. They have not received a single rupee till date.” The release stated that these areas were strategically sensitive because of the presence of ammunition centres and ordnance factories, among others, and their merger would pose a “high security risk”.

“If the area is merged with the PMC limits, the permissible height or floor space index would increase to about 10 to 15 floors, thereby paving the way for development of high-rise buildings. Cantonment areas have a large green cover and their abolition would result in its loss,” the release added.

Chief secretary Tom Jose meets governor Arif Mohammad Khan at Raj Bhavan on Monday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even after chief secretary Tom Jose met him at Raj Bhavan and gave an explanation on behalf of the state government , governor Arif Mohammad Khan made it clear that he will not let state’s act of filing a suit before the Supreme Court against Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) without intimating the same to him to be closed unless the suit is withdrawn.

The governor told reporters on Monday that the explanation from the government won’t be suffice and the case will be closed only if the unlawful action is withdrawn. “The approval of governor is needed and they have gone to the Supreme Court without informing me. That is an illegal act and no explanation can satisfy me,” Khan said. However, the governor refused to divulge what transpired between him and the chief secretary in the closed-door discussion on Monday morning and also about his future course of action on the matter.

He said that the rules for the transaction of business are framed by the cabinet and the governor only approves it and the government should go by the rules. He said that it is neither clash of ego, nor any personal differences with the government and authority does not give licence to anybody to violate the law or the rule. “You are violating the rules and laws that you yourself have framed,” he said. He added that as the constitutional head of the state, he shall be very careful and would try his best to ensure that the business of the government is transacted strictly in accordance with the rules and the Constitution. “I will not allow constitutional machinery to collapse in the state,” he said.

The state had approached the Supreme Court against the CAA, and as per the rules of business, all such matters that affect the relations between the state government and the Centre should be conveyed to the governor before taking it to the apex court.

After the governor took serious exception to the state’s action and sought an explanation from the state government, chief secretary Tom Jose had met the governor with an explanation. It is learned that the chief secretary said that there was no intention to bypass the governor and the government approached the court to allay the concerns of the people. The CS hasn’t submitted a written explanation to the governor, rather tried to make it an informal affair by narrating the sequence of events, said sources.

Meanwhile, responding to CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s comments that the post of governor itself is unnecessary and should be abolished, he said, “Yechury has not been able to find any fault with what I have done, which is the reason why he is making such comments”.

“That’s for the people to decide and they (CPM) should try for that. They are entitled to their view, but this is not the forum,” added Khan.

Nagpur: A 32-year-old man, who had suffered electric shock after he came in contact with high tension wire while working at a construction site in Uppalwadi on January 1, breathed his last at a private hospital on Sunday.

Kapil Nagar police have registered a case of accidental death and launched investigation.

According to police, Vinod Kamble, a resident of Kamptee, was hired by a contractor engaged by one Rehman to construct a house in Uppalwadi. On January 1, Kamble was carrying an iron bar to the slab when it touched the high tension wire. He suffered massive shock and was thrown to the ground.

Jaipur: Rajasthan scored less in sustainable development goals (SDGs) than the previous year questioning the efforts taken by the Congress government in the state. The ranking issued by the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Ayog is based on the progress made by the state in 17 SDGs launched by the UN in 2015. State scored 57 points against the 59 points scored last year on the scale of 100 points and ranked 18 in the country. Leading the pack in Kerala which has scored 76 points. The report was released in December.

Off 17 SDGs, state worst performance comes in sustainable consumption of resources (SDG-12), Zero Hunger (SDG-02), gender equality (SGD-05) and Industry innovation and infrastructure (SDG-09). State scored less than 40 points in these important goals. The best performance comes from Clean water and sanitation (SDG-06), Peace Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG-16) and reducing equalities (SDG-10).

The report says that 36.8% of children under 5 found to be stunted in survey period while the national average in the same period was 34.7%. This parameter comes under Zero Hunger (SDG-2) category and target is to reduced upto 2.5% by 2030. State has achieved 100% target only in in two parameters under SDG 6. “Rajasthan has attained 100% target in rural household with toilets and districts verified with open defection free,” reads the report.

Most of the parameters revolve around healthcare, education, community welfare, environment and governance. The central government has charted out 310 parameters for all 17 SDGs. “State has collected data for 205 indicators out of the total indicators. The reason for not considering several parameters includes ones which are related to the costal and maritime areas,” said an official requesting anonymity.

Expressing concern over the poor performance by the state, Nesar Ahmed of Budget Analysis Research Centre (BARC) says that SDG goals are planned keeping the overall development of every kind of economy, society and political system. “State should make sure to orient its existing schemes and policies keeping the goals in mind also to plan forthcoming polices to meet the goals,” said Ahmed.

Planning department, Rajasthan is the nodal department for SDG implementation. State has formed seven committees of different departments to monitor and implement the schemes. The UNICEF is providing technical and financial support for capacity building. The monitoring is being done mapping of schemes with SDG targets.

431,['21/01/2020'],Kolkata: Police kiosk plan on Maa flyover to curb mishaps,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Cops’ primary focus will be on curbing manja-related accidents

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is planning measures to prevent accidents and stop animals from straying onto Maa flyover. The first step would be to set up two kiosks on the flyover to help the police keep a constant watch. The Tiljala and the East traffic guards are likely to provide personnel for this.

Sources said the traffic guards had earlier approached KMDA and Lalbazar to request the same. They had stated that the kiosks would serve four purposes — detecting Chinese manja, preventing cattle from straying onto the flyover, prevent speeding of vehicles and ensure immediate police assistance in case of emergencies or accidents.

Work to set up the police kiosks will start in February and the agency that will take up the project will need to complete the job within 30 days. The estimated project cost is about Rs 1.7 lakh.

Cops said the most important impact that these kiosks will have is curbing Chinese manja-related accidents. “Our presence will act as a deterrent. We can act as soon as we get any information of kite threads obstructing traffic here,” an officer said. “Moreover, bikers tend to speed on stretches where there are no speed monitors. Cops posted at the kiosks will deter them,” he said.

KMDA is also working on a proposal to install a six-foot barricade or steel net at specific spots on both sides of the flyover to prevent Chinese kite threads from drifting onto the structure.

Moreover, KMDA has planned to improve the infrastructure around Maa flyover as the road surface of Park Circus 4 No. bridge has developed cracks and potholes at several spots, necessitating repair works. A median will also be constructed from the bridge approach to Maa flyover pillar number 80 on the Park Circus connector.

Further, the authorities will install a pavement on the eastern service road of EM Bypass between Pragati Maidan police station and PC Chandra Gardens for better pedestrian and vehicular movement on the stretch.

KOLKATA: A 21-year-old resident of Murshidabad’s Jangipur has alleged that around 2pm on January 17 two cops threatened him and extorted Rs 21.8 lakh that he had collected from retailers Burrabazar and Posta on behalf of his company. The youth, Biswanath Das, is presently staying at a guest house on Nalini Seth Road.

The Posta police have registered a case of cheating, but said that there are certain gaps in Das’s account. According to the police, Das had checked into the guest house on January 13 and had returned on January 17 from Burrabazar after making collecting some dues on behalf of his company. “Two men barged into my room and asked to pay up. When I asked them to their ID cards, they were reluctant. Instead, they argued with me, stashed the money in a bag and left,” Das alleged in his complaint.

Police said they were trying to get CCTV footage from the guesthouse to verify the sequence of events. With the long weekend — which bring about a surge in sales — around the corner, cops fear more such criminals will arrive from other states.

PUNE: The security firm owner’s claim on Friday that he was robbed of Rs 2.8 lakh, including cash and valuables, on Shirole Road was bogus and he had lodged the FIR to avoid paying salaries to his employees, police said.

Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of Deccan Gymkhana police said, “We checked the CCTV footage of the entire area, but they did not reveal anything suspicious. When we questioned the firm owner about the robbery repeatedly, each time his statement had some deviation. Thus, we have concluded that no such robbery occurred.”

Lagad said, “Police will write a case summary report to the court soon on the probe with the provision of prosecution (against the complainant).”

He said the security firm owner (42) was a resident of Somatne Phata. “He failed to pay salaries to his staffers on January 1. So, he staged the robbery,” he said.

The security firm owner on Friday had lodged a complaint with the Deccan Gymkhana police that he was pulled inside an autorickshaw around 6.40pm on Shirole road and taken to a secluded area. Then the suspects robbed his bag containing Rs2.53 lakh, cellphone and watch.

436,['21/01/2020'],Haryana: Anil Vij orders disciplinary action against CID ADGP Anil Kumar Rao,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Anil Vij

CHANDIGARH: The battle between Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and home minister Anil Vij over the control of the criminal investigation department (CID), the intelligence wing of the state, intensified on Monday after Vij ordered disciplinary action against ADGP Anil Kumar Rao, who heads the contentious department.

Vij formally wrote to additional chief secretary (home) Vijay Vardhan on Monday ordering action against Rao, an IPS officer.

Vij has accused Rao of not following his directions and orders in the past. According to information, Vij has asked the additional chief secretary (home) to charge sheet Rao under All-India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules.

The order has sent the home department officials into a tizzy and Rao as an IPS officer is governed by the rules and regulations framed for All India Services officers by the department of personnel & training and the any action against him would require permission of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

Sources close to Vij said the home minister had referred to issues related to CID reports during the assembly elections, details of security provided to people in Haryana and the details related to phone tapping in the state in his letter to the additional chief secretary (home).

For over last one week, the CID has not been briefing the home minister as is the norm.

Vij’s decision to initiate disciplinary action against Rao has come a day after he wrote to CM Khattar, urging him to replace Rao with IPS officer Shrikant Jadhav, who is posted as director of state crime record bureau at Madhuban. In his letter to Khattar, Vij is also learnt to have sought departmental action against Rao for disobedience.

The Haryana government had recently initiated plans to withdraw CID wing from Vij, who heads the home department, which traditionally has been overseeing the department.

For the past one month, Vij has been vocal about the CID wing and its functioning. Acting on Vij’s recommendation, the Haryana government constituted a three-member committee headed by ACS (home) to review its working and for its upgradation.

There is still no clarity over the issue of who controls the CID wing as the Haryana Assembly website, which was updated recently to show Khattar having charge of CID wing, is yet to update the portfolios and the page is inaccessible.

437,['21/01/2020'],Want to give Metro station co’s name? Opt for co-branding,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Now that over 3,500 people are riding the Metro daily on Reach I ( Sitabuldi to Khapri stretch), MahaMetro has floated tenders to earn revenue from its stations. So far it has received a satisfactory response.

MahaMetro wants to earn revenue from stations in two ways. One is through co-branding and the other is through leasing out commercial spaces.

A Metro official said that co-branding involves adding the name of the successful bidder to the station’s name. “For example, if the name of the company is XYZ and it has successfully bid for the airport station then we will name it XYZ airport station. This will be displayed on our signboards at the station so that passengers using it see the name of the company. The company will have to pay us royalty in return,” he added.

The co-branding period is for five years after which tenders will be floated again. So far, MahaMetro has received bids for three stations. It had floated a similar tender in the first quarter of 2019 for at grade stations but did not get any response as Metro was yet to start commercial operations and only joy rides were being operated.

This time, too, there is no response for Reach III (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch) as it is yet to become operational. The stretch is ready since September 2019 but is yet to become operational as MahaMetro authorities are waiting for the prime minister and chief minister to open it. The two leaders have not shown any interest so far.

MahaMetro has also floated tenders for leasing out twelve commercial spaces in seven stations – Khapri, Airport, Jaiprakash Nagar, Lokmanya Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Institution of Engineers and Jhansi Rani Square. The area of these spaces range from about 15 square metre to 80 sq m. Here, too, six bids have been received only for Reach I as Reach III is yet to become operational.

MahaMetro plans to earn more than 50% of its revenue from non-ticket sources. The main sources will be premium on extra floor to space index (FSI) in Metro corridor, stamp duty surcharge, sale of commercial space, etc. Due to slump in the realty sector, Metro’s earnings from these sources has not been satisfactory.

Manohar Lal Khattar addresses the House during special session in Chandigarh on Monday

CHANDIGARH: The special session of Haryana assembly ended up on an abrupt note on Monday as the House was adjourned after an hour with the ratification of the 126th Amendment of the Constitution.

The business advisory committee of the assembly rescheduled the commencement of the sitting after postponing it for 30 minutes, which left opposition parties and officials guessing. Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya also kept his address limited to the scope of ratifying the central act.

“The special session of Haryana Assembly has been convened for ratifying amendments to the Constitution falling within the purview of clause (d) of proviso to clause (2) of article 368, proposed to be made by the Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill, 2019, as passed by both the Houses of Parliament. Rest, we shall have detailed address ahead of budget session of assembly,” he said.

Saying that, governor called it a day. After this, speaker Gian Chand Gupta announced the commencement of obituary session. It began with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar reading out the obituaries. Among those who were remembered and paid homage to included former Union minister I D Swami, former Karnal MP Ashwani Chorpa and former minister Shamsher Singh Surjewala .

Soon after the obituaries, the parliamentary affairs minister moved the proposal for ratifying the 126th Amendment related to SC/ST Act and approving the passing of rules related to GST before adjoining sine die.

Earlier, there were plans of the governor’s address, which would have been followed by a discussion on address and then a special training session for first-time MLAs. There are 46 first-timers in the assembly.

The governor had arrived in the assembly nearly 40 minutes behind schedule. By that time, the business advisory committee had met and rescheduled timings. Due to rescheduling, the speech document of the governor address could not be laid.

Earlier, it was announced that the three-day session shall have the governor’s address, discussion on address in addition to the voice vote for the SC/ST Act.

After Haryana ratified the 126th Amendment of the Constitution, the state will have the same pattern of reservation of seats for scheduled castes/schedlued tribes candidates for the parliamentary and assembly seats. In Haryana, two seats of the parliament and 17 seats of assembly will be reserved for the next 10 years.

Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Narayanan said the country was facing an undeclared Emergency-like situation. He exhorted the people to join hands and hold agitations irrespective of political differences. “We cannot accept the move of determining citizenship based on religion. Citizenship is a right and it is not anybody’s charity. All people should come together to protect the right,” he added.

Narayanan, who is the patron of Kerala Janakeeya Kootayma, said the organization would conduct a 613km long march from Kasaragod to Raj Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram. The march would begin from Uppala in Kasaragod on February 1 and reach Raj Bhavan march on March 2.

When asked whether he would be a part of the proposed human chain by CPM, he replied that nobody has approached him yet. People cutting across political parties and social and cultural leaders would participate in the long march. A mass convention will be held at Kozhikode on January 22. Narayanan will inaugurate the convention.

447,['21/01/2020'],‘Sponge city’ mooted to tackle floods,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The floods in the past two years had devastating effects on the state. Learning from the disasters, the irrigation department is planning major initiatives to reduce the intensity and frequency of floods.

One of the major initiatives planned is ‘sponge city’, which was effectively implemented in China. The department is planning to implement a similar sponge city initiative in Kochi on a pilot basis, and later in other urban areas.

In sponge city, urban areas with more spaces for wetlands, ponds and permeable spaces, can passively absorb rainwater and thus reduce the severity of floods.

In addition to China’s sponge city, the department is also planning to implement ‘room for river’ programme inspired from the Netherlands in Kuttanad.

Experts from China, the Netherlands, the US and other major countries will attend a two-day ‘national conference on policies and strategies for flood management: Kerala scenario’ which will begin on Thursday. This will be the first attempt by the department to formulate a policy for flood resilient Kerala. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the conference, which will be attended by policymakers, engineers, natural and social scientists, disaster management professionals and researchers to exchange their ideas and experiences.

The conference is organized under the aegis of Central Water Commission’s World Bank-aided projects such as national hydrology project and dam rehabilitation and improvement project.

Key speakers of the event will be the Netherlands water adviser Paul Van Meel, senior engineer at China’s Shenzhen water planning and design institute Sun Xiang, lead engineer at RTI International Jonathan Quebbeman and David Yales from National Centre For Atmospheric Research. Technical presentation will be followed by a brainstorming session led by an expert panel for formulating policies and strategies for flood management in the state.

The conference will also discuss feasibility of constructing multipurpose flood control dams across six rivers — Periyar, Chalakudy, Chaliyar, Pamba, Achankoil and Meenachil.

Speaking to reporters about the conference, water resources minister K Krishnankutty said that the state would evolve a policy on effectively using its water resource. “The overall water requirements for various purposes such as drinking, irrigation and power generation by 2030 would be around 1,000 thousand million cubic feet (tmc). However, only around 300tmc is available now. However, controversies would stall new proposals for dams. Had there been no dams, the situation of the state would have been worse in various basins during floods,” the minister said. The minister added that only 4 lakh hectares of the total 22 lakh hectares was currently being irrigated.

K A Joshy, chief engineer, design, research and investigation wing of the irrigation department, said that the flood control dams planned in the state have multiple purposes such as irrigation, drinking water and power generation.

“Unlike the existing dams which use only 8-10%, the proposed dams can utilise 25-30% cushion for flood control through spillway regulation,” he said.

File photo of ex-CM Vasundhara Raje’s bungalow

JAIPUR: The state government on Monday informed Rajasthan High Court that a notice was sent to former chief minister Jagannath Pahadia in connection to facilities availed by him including government bungalow, driver, vehicle and others.

The court was also informed that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje had already surrendered the facilities of driver, vehicle and staff given to her except her bungalow. However, the government also sought some time from the court for the compliance of the order and stated that they were making a policy on facilities to be given to sitting and former MLAs .

Replying to the contempt petition, MS Singhvi, advocate general, informed that the bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice NS Dhadha that Raje had surrendered various facilities given to her on January 17.

Singhvi also informed the court that state government was bringing a policy on facilities to be given to MLAs. During the hearing the advocate general sought some time to file the compliance in this regard.

The court was hearing the contempt petition filed Milapchand Dandia.

Advocate Vimal Chaudhary said the contempt petition was filed in the court since the state government did not comply with the September 4, 2019 order by the high court in which it had declared “the amended law to provide facilities to the CM as unconstitutional and illegal”.

The Supreme Court has also rejected the Special Leave Petition (SLP) by the state government in this matter.

A division bench of Rajasthan High Court on September 4 last year had struck down the Rajasthan Ministers' Salaries (Amendment) Act, 2017 which provided ‘extra facilities’ to former chief ministers, including lifelong government accommodation and a staff of 10. Though the state government had approached the Supreme Court to challenge the high court’s order, no relief was granted in this regard.

Shamsher Singh Surjewala

JIND: Congress leader and former Haryana minister Shamsher Singh Surjewala (87) passed away on Monday, after a prolonged illness.

Surjewala, father of Congress communication wing in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala, breathed his last at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi.

The five-time MLA was cremated at Narwana town of Jind district in the afternoon, where several leaders, including former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state party president Kumari Selja, BJP’s former Union minister Birender Singh and many current and former MLAs, were present. Shamsher is survived by his wife, Randeep and two daughters.

In September 1957, Shamsher started his practice as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and jurisprudence before moving to grassroots politics, after getting elected as the managing director of the Sangrur Central Co-operative Bank in 1959-60 and then as chairman of panchayat samiti, Kalayat (now in Kaithal district) in 1961 and again in 1964.

Shamsher was elected MLA from Narwana assembly constituency in 1967, 1977, 1982 and 1991; and once from Kaithal in 2005. He shifted to Kaithal in 2005, after Narwana was declared a reserved seat.

Randeep took his legacy forward by wining the election twice from Kaithal in 2009 and 2014. Shamsher was also the former president of the Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee. He was a president of the Haryana Krishak Samaj and fought for the rights of farmers. Surjewala had served as a minister in the Haryana government for four times and was also elected to the Rajya Sabha once in 1993.

Congress leaders also expressed grief over former minister Shamsher Singh Surjewala’s passing away. Punjab CM Amarinder Singh said he was saddened. “My thoughts and prayers are with the family in this hour of grief,” he tweeted.

The Haryana assembly also paid tributes. Both CM Manohar Lal Khattar and Hooda described Surjewala as an able and experienced leader.

Hooda said, “My tribute to the departed soul. May God give peace to his soul and strength to the family to bear this grief.” “Deeply pained by the demise of former Haryana Congress chief, former Rajya Sabha MP and former Haryana minister Shamsher Singh Surjewala,” Kumari Selja said. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath have also condoled his demise.

450,['21/01/2020'],Wedding with a difference where farm widows received charity!,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Vandana Ranade, 40, whose husband Mahadev, a farmer at Dhapewada in Kalmeshwar taluka, had ended his life around three months ago after being unable to repay surmounting loans, was one of the farm widows to be handed over a cheque of Rs11,111 at the wedding reception of Bablu and Bhumika Chaudhuri at a venue in Kalamna on Monday.

The sum meant a lot for this farm widow with two children as she is still waiting for the government’s compensation.

It was a call taken by Bablu, who grew up at Bela in Umrer taluka. He wanted to do something for the farmers of India, especially the ones from Vidarbha, where the suicide count has drawn attention internationally.

Son of Kuhi police station’s assistant sub-inspector Kawdhuji, Bablu pursued higher education in agricultural business and horticulture chain management followed by a research in Netherlands. But Vidarbha was always in his heart. When it came to the most memorable day of his life, Bablu, who is currently working as assistant manager (procurement) in a World Bank project in Jaipur, decided to do something for the farm widows of Vidarbha. He was supported by his bride Bhumika who runs an education consultancy in Delhi as well as in the city. She is also pursuing her bachelors in vocational studies.

After earning four fellowships from The Netherlands government, Bablu saved his salary since August last year and also convinced Bhumika and her family to wholeheartedly support his noble intention.

The Chaudhuris and Pandes agreed to make the occasion special with their charitable deeds for farm widows, an orphanage and an individual.

Amid the long queue of the guests bestowing blessings by sprinkling ‘akshada’ or rice grains, the newly wed couple, flanked by their parents, handed over the cheques to the beneficiaries.

Bablu, who is also an international speaker on youth empowerment and farmers’ product chain management, said he wanted to help the children of farmers who ended their lives. “We decided to choose five farmers’ families who suffered due to the suicide of their sole bread earners. We got help from social activist Ram Newle. The objective was to provide assistance in whatever way possible on our most memorable day. We want to continue with this practice,” said Bablu.

Manda Narnaware, whose husband Hariramji ended his life around a year ago by consuming poison in his farm, has two children. Working as farm labourer, she is supporting son Ashutosh and daughter Priyanka’s education.

“It was a very touching moment when we received an invitation to be part of this wedding and also get help which we badly need,” said the farm widow from Narkhed taluka who received a cheque of Rs11,111 from Bhumika.

Vikas Shende of Jeevan Ashray Vruddhashram and Child Care Centre said he was grateful for the gesture by the Pandes and Chaudhuris. “May the almighty bless this couple abundantly, especially because they did not forget the pain of the needy in their moment of joy,” he said.

Bablu and Bhumika also handed over a cheque of Rs11,111 to Shegaon-based Seema Shende whose husband Murlidhar had committed suicide at his farm in December last year. The family of Balkishor Zade, who ended his life in Wardha district in December last year as he was unable to get his dues from the irrigation department for three years, was also given a cheque.

451,['21/01/2020'],Women demand nod for anti-CAA protest at Eidgah till 10pm,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Different Ambedkarite and women’s rights groups have extended their support to the over 400 women protesting on the second day of Shaheenbagh style protest at Eidgah Ground, Jafar Nagar, on Monday evening. Among the many speeches at the protest, there was a call for ‘medically treating some predator-minded East Nagpur people’, a veiled reference to the RSS.

At around 6pm, an hour beyond the permitted time for the protest, senior police inspector Sunil Gangurde drove a police jeep into the Eidgah and used the public address system atop his vehicle to issue an ultimatum to the protesters, asking them to peacefully vacate the premises. The protesting women and around 50 men left the venue, though not without some hard negotiations with the police to extend the protest timing.

A group of men requested Gangurde to let the women carry on for another two hours, till 8pm. They also demanded extended timing for rest of the protest — slated to go on till Jan 29. Gangurde expressed his inability citing orders from higher ups.

The first day of protest did not encounter any challenges, as a nearby school was closed, it being a Sunday. On Monday, the protesters didn’t use loudspeakers between 11am and 2pm to avoid disturbing the school.

Amid talks of the permission getting extended till 8pm or 10pm, more women walked into the venue in the evening, which saw a bigger turnout than the day before.

“11am is too early for many women to finish their household tasks. The police must understand that women are not creating any law and order situation. Despite several appeals, they forced us to return. We want to sit in solidarity with our sisters in Shaheenbagh, who are braving Delhi’s cold weather,” said a women protester.

Initially, the women declared they would stay put till 10pm. Congress activist Bunty Shelke, who visited the venue, also supported them, announcing from the mike that “the cops present must convey to CP that today women will be here till 8pm”.

The organizers now plan to move a fresh application seeking 1pm to 9pm slot for protest from Tuesday onwards.

Earlier in the day, former radiology professor Dr Krishna Kamble said, “Chicken-minded people headquartered in Nagpur are thinking that ‘minorities are chicken feed’, which they are planning to feast on.”

Dr Kamble’s comments came while narrating the story of a person who feels he is chicken feed (dana).Finally, he is cured after treatment but doubts the chicken since ‘it has not been treated yet’. “Now, it is time to treat such predators headquartered in East Nagpur,” he said.

During the day, women speakers exhorted people to come out of their homes in large numbers and bring their kids prepared with patriotic songs and speeches.

The 6km-long priority corridor of the metro rail project extends from Taj East Gate to Jama Masjid.

AGRA: The operation of the Agra Metro Rail Project, proposed to be started by November 2021, is likely to be delayed. It has been 10 months since the approval was given by the Union Cabinet, but the construction is yet to start. The Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) lacks the required clearances to carry out the construction works in the city.

Besides the fact that the Supreme Court, so far, has not permitted cutting of trees, the project is not yet approved by the Taj Trapezium Zone Authority (TTZ), forest department, Archeological Survey of India (ASI) and some other departments. The 6km-long priority corridor of the metro rail project extends from Taj East Gate to Jama Masjid.

A senior official of the Agra Development Authority (ADA) said, “The required land for developing Agra metro rail infrastructure has been identified. It will take at least three more months to start the construction work. UPMRC is trying to get approval of the apex court and other agencies for time-bound implementation of the project.”

On February 28, 2019, the Union Cabinet approved the Agra metro rail project, which is estimated to cost Rs 8,379.62 crore. A total of 27 stations are planned to be developed along 29.4 km of the rail corridor in the city.

According to the detailed project report (DRP) approved by the Union Cabinet, the Agra Metro Rail Project will have two corridors which will pass through the heart of the city and will connect prominent tourist places, including the Taj Mahal , Agra Fort and Sikandara as well as ISBT, Raja Ki Mandi railway station, medical college, Agra Cantt railway station, Collectorate, Sanjay Place and densely populated residential areas.

The length of Sikandara to Taj East Gate corridor is proposed to be 14 km which is partly elevated and partly underground. This corridor would comprise 13 stations (six elevated and seven underground). The length of the second corridor from Agra Cantt to Kalindi Vihar would be 15.4 km comprising 14 stations (all elevated).

The metro rail will cover 1km in two minutes. The distance between Sikandra and Taj East gate will be covered in 28 minutes and distance between Agra Cantt to Kalindi Vihar will be covered in 32 minutes. About 20 lakh population of the city is expected to benefit from the metro rail project.

Farmers protesting outside the district administrative complex of Bathinda on Monday

BATHINDA: To demand withdrawal of government action taken in cases of stubble burning, farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) started three-day protests outside the offices of deputy commissioners in 13 districts of Punjab on Monday.

The union is demanding withdrawal of cases registered against farmers for burning paddy stubble, waiver of fines imposed on them, setting right red entries made in the land records, and release of impounded combine harvesters.

They blocked traffic on one side of the road outside Bathinda district administrative complex .

Farmers demanded immediate release of compensation of Rs 2,500 per acre to all eligible farmers owning up to five acres of land who had not burnt paddy stubble as per directions of Supreme Court.

Farm organisation activists also supported ongoing protests across the country against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and demanded its withdrawal.

BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said, “The Punjab government took action against farmers, but failed to provide a workable and sustainable alternative to burning crop stubble. We want the government to withdraw all these steps taken against farmers as they had no other option but to burn stubble. For this, we will protest continuously for 72 hours.”

456,['21/01/2020'],‘Modi govt akin to drunkard selling family silver’,"This story is from January 21, 2020

Nagpur: Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) founder Prakash Ambedkar on Saturday compared Narendra Modi government with a drunkard selling family silver to fuel his addiction.

“Just like a drunkard sells jewellery and utensils of home for purchasing liquor, Centre is selling its stake in Navratna companies. These are golden hen providing a revenue of over Rs1 lakh crore every year,” he told reporters.

Ambedkar reiterated his statements that funds meant for proposed Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial at Indu Mills should be spent on modernization of Wadia Hospital for children in Mumbai. On being criticized by members of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over this, he said, “I don’t care about anyone, as they are not true disciples of Dr Ambedkar. Serving living human beings is more important than building statues. If the funds are being utilized for a hospital, it would help us in protecting our future generations. Even a Bombay High Court judge had made similar observations.”

Endorsing tourism minister Aditya Thackeray’s demand for making Mumbai a 24x7 city, Ambedkar said it was a must for citizens, particularly those who work in night shifts. “There’s a big disparity in social lives of citizens. Those in morning and evening shift can enjoy social life but those working in night are deprived of it. It gives rise to increased crime.”

On Congress leader Kapil Sibal’s statement that states can’t refuse to implement Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said they could express dissent by uniting and handing over a joint representation to the President of India. “The states must explain to the President different parties were ruling them and Centre whose ideologies don’t match. Therefore, national debate is required on the topic with a larger consensus. In my opinion, even the Supreme Court shouldn’t interfere in such issues.”

On Vinayak Savarkar, Ambedkar said he was undoubtedly a revolutionary leader but he had a different face when it came to his alleged relations with British government. The VBA president said though there was no recession, the government was pushing the economy towards bankruptcy.

Charging the Centre and state with crushing the tribal movement, the former MP challenged them to publish a note written by late prime minister Indira Gandhi to the Japan Government when latter sought permission to excavate minerals from Surjagarh mine in Gadchiroli.

“The British failed to win the tribal dominated areas in Bastar, near Palghar and Gadchiroli in their tenure. Indira’s note would make us realize importance of national security. Both governments are trying to exploit the tribals who want to protect their Jal, Jangal and Jameen. It is the reason the Maoist movement is still continuing and those supporting them are labelled as Urban Naxals,” he said.

On forthcoming budget, Ambedkar said in the last budget government had targeted a revenue of Rs24 lakh crore but in November, the economic survey report indicated it wouldn’t cross Rs11 lakh crore. “For running a country, Rs14 lakh crore is needed. The government is out to sell the Navratnas started by our earlier leaders with a particular vision in the mind for raising the Rs3 lakh crore shortfall,” he said.

CHENNAI: What happens when a civic body is unable to dump garbage at a designated spot? It empties trucks in a legacy dump yard created on a large water body.This is the state of affairs in Pallavaram. Garbage collected from houses in Pallavaram municipality is being sent to a dump yard south of the Pallavaram Periya Eri (lake).David Manohar, a social activist and local resident, took photographs of vehicles ferrying garbage and emptying it in the dump yard. “This has been happening for the past few days. Garbage collection from houses has also become erratic,” he said.The legacy waste in this dump yard is supposed to be biomined to help restore the water body. (See graphic)Sources in the municipality said problems began after National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulled up Tambaram and Pallavaram municipalities for dumping waste in the Vengadamangalam yard located on the Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road.In 2015, it was decided that waste from these two civic bodies would be sent to the waste-to-energy plant in Vengadamangalam. The waste collected from houses would be taken to a transfer station, where it would be compressed and then sent to the Vengadamangalam yard. However, the state government found several lapses in the working of the private contractor and work stopped.Also, reports by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board showed that frequent fires broke out in the yard leading to pollution over which nearby residents protested.Advocates appearing for the municipalities before NGT said that there would be no fresh dumping of garbage from September 2019 in Vengadamangalam. But then where was this garbage going? Residents of Pallavaram found this answer — into the lake.An official from Pallavaram municipality told TOI they were in talks to transfer the garbage to Perungudi dump yard which is under the control of Greater Chennai Corporation .S Narasimhan, a resident and former councillor of Pallavaram municipality, said there was major mismanagement at the Vengadamangalam yard as well as in the biomining project in Pallavaram.“A work order was given a year ago, but there appears to be no change in the size of the garbage mounds. Frequent fires cause pollution while the water in the lake, used by local residents, is polluted,” Narasimhan said. “How can the government itself contribute to polluting a water body,” Narasimhan asked.Manohar has documented how raw sewage is being pumped out from a collection well into a channel connecting Pallavaram lake and Kilkattalai lake. Sewage is being let outinto the Periya Eri through an inlet channel.Despite repeated calls, the Pallavaram municipality commissioner could not be reached for comments.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73471266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-824003,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pallavaram-municipality-dumps-waste-in-lake-chosen-for-biomining/articleshow/73450661.cms

Gurgaon: Environmentalists have highlighted encroachment over 15 acres in the Aravalis, almost a week after pointing out that another patch of land had been taken over in a similar manner.

The activists said they had recently visited Behalpa along the Damadama Lok Marg and found that large tracts of land had been encroached upon.

They referred to a few Google images from 2018, which showed tree cover over a large area and a waterbody nearby. They pointed to a few images captured recently to buttress their point that the green cover has shrunk within a year.

“Recently, a few of us had visited the site in the forest areas of Behalpa, right on the Damadama Lok Marg. As one turns left to go inside the forest, there are huge tracts of land that have been encroached upon. The area is approximately 15 acres,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, a green activist who filed a complaint with the chief conservator of forests.

The area, Chandra said, falls in mustil no 17, 18 and 24. “Hundreds of trees have been felled and the area levelled using an earthmover. It has also been fenced using a barbed wire. At mustil no 24, a 12ft wall has been constructed along with a room,” she added.

Residents said the area had over 200 trees, most of which have now been cut and the area fenced.

District forest officer Subhash Yadav said he had received the complaint on Sunday. “We immediately checked our records and found that it is private land. Only kila no 25 of mustil no. 24 (a small part) has Aravali plantation. Trees were cut in the area two years ago. We need to check old records for that,” he added.

Lalapet flyover (File photo)

SECUNDERABAD: Closure of the Lalapet flyover for close to eight months has left commuters fuming as they claim that repair work taken up by the GHMC is going on at a snail’s pace. The GHMC had commenced the repair work of the flyover, which is regularly used by commuters to reach Habsiguda, Tarnaka, Nacharam, Moulali and ECIL X roads, in May last year. Traffic curbs were imposed on the flyover from April 27, 2019 wherein only one side of the flyover was open for vehicular movement.

As per the initial deadline set by the GHMC, the repair work was expected to be completed by August. Due to delay in procurement of bearings, the officials were unable to complete it on time. Subsequently, the GHMC had decided to reopen the flyover for public use by December. However, the municipal corporation failed to keep its promise of reopening it by year-end, thereby leaving commuters agitated. “For the last eight months, we are forced to take a detour to reach Tarnaka, Habsiguda and Nacharam. Closure of the flyover has caused traffic snarls on Mirjalguda T junction,” said Rajesh Modugu , a resident of Moulali who regularly uses the flyover.

Attributing the delay to traffic diversions, the GHMC said the repair work is nearing completion. “There was delay in traffic diversion even after diversion permissions were accorded. There were also a lot of damages which were unanticipated. We are expected to reopen the flyover latest by January-end,” assured Ravinder Raju, superintendent engineer (projects).

Kochi: When Robert Eugene Bechler alias Bob (76), a US yachtsman , and his wife Alexandria (32) sailed to Sudan after a three-year halt at Kochi Marina with their two-year-old twins Ethan and Harper (born during their stay in Kochi) in SV Sisiutl on March 26, 2018, their dream was to reach Cyprus eventually and settle down in the country after selling off the yacht.

But that dream crumbled after their yacht hit a coral reef and sank off Sudan’s coast two weeks ago. Though Bob managed to save his family with the aid of a lifeboat, their ‘home and belongings’, which he had earned over the past 19 years of his sailing life, were lost. With a bagful of what he could salvage from the wreckage, the family returned to his hometown Seattle, seeking refuge. It is learnt that his boat was not insured.

Bob posted about the incident a few days after the accident. The yacht was sailing to the port city of Suakin after a halt in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa.

“Good and bad news. Alex and twins are safe. The pictures show everything we were able to salvage. I can’t watch. In middle of the night we were surfing down some big waves when we hit a reef. Sisiutl was immediately holed and filled with water. Her disassembly is now complete when the keel-stepped main mast chewed thru deck while coming down. I am beat up and bedridden. Delusional bedridden,” said his FB post.

TOI had exclusively reported the heartwarming yachting story of the family on March 27, 2018 after they left Kochi. It was in March 2016 that Bob and Alex came to Kochi in Sisiutl as part of their voyage towards the Red Sea and berthed at the Marina. Alex, who became pregnant during their stay here, gave birth to twins in a city hospital in January 2017 and they stayed in their yacht for two years until the babies were ‘ready to sail’.

The two weeks in crisis-hit Sudan too was troublesome for the family. Bob’s FB updates said they could not leave their hotel because there was gunfire in the streets. “The hotel is short on food and I have lost any semblance of a sense of humor. I can’t fly out because sanctions stop financial transactions. I tried booking a ticket and failed at payment stage because local currency is not recognized. Never been more helpless,” said the update posted on January 14.

Though TOI tried to contact Bob through FB, there was no response. But Bob later confirmed through another post that they have reached Seattle safely on Monday. “Arrived safe and somewhat sound in Seattle. Now to get some lost sleep,” the post said.

According to sailors at Kochi Marina, who had frequent contacts with Bob, the boat was not insured. “Many yachts out there have no insurance as companies charge high premium for yachts that sail around the world. For many yachtsmen, it may not be affordable. It is learnt that, Bob’s yacht too was uninsured,” said Wade Alarie, a Canadian yachter at Kochi Marina.

Agra: Students of Aligarh Muslim University’s Women’s College boycotted classes on Monday when the institution reopened after an extended winter break, demanding the resignation of the vice-chancellor, registrar and proctor over the university’s failure to protect students from police excesses on the campus on December 15. They have also announced that their boycott will continue till the officials step down.

Later, a group of women students took out a protest march on the campus against CAA and NRC and shouted slogans of ‘azadi’. They also urged the administration to revoke the false charges and cases against the students.

Nida, one of the protesters, said that they would continue the boycott till AMU VC Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid quit their posts. She added that they have submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President of India, to the principal of the college.

Similarly, the students of law, life sciences, commerce, science and agriculture faculties of AMU also joined the women students’ protest. They urged the Union government to immediately roll back the Citizenship (Amendment) Act stating that it’s against the pluralistic foundations of India and tarnishes the principle of equality in the country.

Mohammad Ghayasuddin, a court member of life science department, said, “We believe that CAA is a divisive law that was principally brought after Assam NRC to accommodate the Hindus who could not make it into the list due to lack of documents. The Act deliberately kept the Muslims out of loop to send an Islamophobic message to the nation. We reject the BJP’s hatred for Muslims and want the Union government to roll back CAA.”

The protesters also demanded that the NPR exercise should be stopped immediately claiming that the initiative is the first step towards a nationwide NRC.

Another student said, “The CAA, NRC and NPR combine is anti-poor, anti-Dalit and anti-minority. Indians are mostly poor and can’t even afford to obtain documents to prove citizenship.”

Claiming that the police and RAF used disproportionate force against students during the violence on AMU campus on December 15, the protesters sought stringent action against the guilty. They said that the campus is not safe under an insecure administration and demanded that the VC must resign along with his team so that students can go back to classrooms.

Indore: In major relief to passengers, who have booked Air India Dubai-Indore flight between February 1 and April 30, the airline announced to reinstate the flight after cancelling it two days ago.

“The flight AI -904 has been reinstated at the same timing as it was operating earlier and affected passengers will now be moving on the same flight without any change,” said an official with the airline.

The airline operates the flight thrice a week. The flight departs from Dubai at 8:10pm and lands at Indore at 12.45am. On January 17, the airline had announced to suspend the flight from February 1 to April 30 for construction of taxi-way near the runway.

Airport authority had proposed to carry out the development work during night hours between 11pm and 5am from February 1 to April 30, 2020. Air India was asked to re-schedule its flight as its scheduled arrival timing was coinciding with the schedule planned for construction of the taxi-way to provide a path for aircraft at the airport connecting runway with 15 parking bays. Thereafter, the airline announced to cancel its Dubai-Indore flight.

However, on Monday, after communicating with the airline as well as travel agents, airport authority on Monday agreed to halt the proposed development work to pave way for arrival of the airline as per its scheduled timing.

Airport director Aryama Sanyal said that the board has approved their proposal of halting development work for about two hours to avoid any impact on movement of international flights to and from Indore airport.

“We have decided to stop development work between 00.00hrs and 02.00hrs to pave way for the AI flight, which comes from Dubai at 00.30 hrs and departs to Delhi at 01:30hrs,” said Sanyal.

The announcement has come as a relief for hundreds of passengers who have booked tickets and were supposed to travel on this route. Travel agents association members had estimated that about 2000 passengers were directly getting affected with cancellation of the flight. “It is a big relief for all passengers travelling from Dubai to Indore during this period. It could have caused huge inconvenience to passengers if they would have had to travel via Delhi and Mumbai,” said the association president Hemendra Singh Jadon.

Jaipur: A 20-year-old person, who failed in class XII exam three years ago, was arrested by police for allegedly impersonating as an IAS officer on Monday.

Police arrested Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Hindaun, from a luxury hotel near Sawai Man Singh stadium. Ashok Nagar police had received two complaints against him from two people as they suspected that Kumar was not an IAS.

When police received the complaint, they took the steps cautiously as the two were alleging that a person impersonating was IAS. Senior police ifficers verified their complaint. “Kumar had demanded money from the two and promised them jobs. He presented himself to the complainants that he was posted as OSD at Rashrapati Bhawan,” said ACP Ashok Gupta said.

He said the duo had given him some money, which he had demanded.

Kumar had asked two persons to come with more money at the luxury hotel, where police reached and arrested him. It is not for the first time he had been arrested. Earlier, he was arrested by Bajaj Nagar police for the same crime.

CHENNAI: Walking to school has become increasingly difficult for students of Vivekananda Centenary Girls Higher Secondary School on Saravana Street, Mint.

They have to cross a narrow stretch of 100m before they enter the school, walking past two e-toilets that are unusable and awash in filth. Besides, vendors from local markets relieve themselves outside, with some also defecating there. “It is disgusting. They know there is a school here, but people still come in groups and use this space as urinals. We have a hard time crossing this road,” said a Class VIII student.

The toilets were set up a year ago, and as residents and school authorities pointed out, became dysfunctional soon after inauguration. They were rarely cleaned and people now use the adjoining walls, which includes one near the school entrance, as toilets.

School faculty members showed a letter sent six months ago to the district collector requesting to either shut or move the toilets to another place. “A few local officials, including the area engineer and zonal officer also came to the spot and inspected it. They saw the place was in a mess and promised to take action. We are still waiting for it,” said Shashi Shikhananda, secretary.

Several parents have complained about the unhygienic road the girls are forced to take. They are worried it might spread infection or disease since that side of the road is hardly cleaned. “But what more can we do? We have made our staff stand outside while students come to school and leave for home. But the situation persists,” said M Vijayalakshmi, maths teacher and school coordinator. She said the condition of the road is worse when it rains. “Sewage flows on to the road and we have a hard time,” she said.

A few residents who live opposite the toilets complained about the stink and the mosquito infestation because of the stagnant water nearby. “We are forced to keep all our windows closed. It becomes bad in the evenings,” said V Padma, a resident. The place has also become a hub for alcoholics at nights, she added. “They sometimes get into loud arguments. We are scared.”

The zonal officer of the area did not respond despite many attempts to contact him.

472,['21/01/2020'],"For Swachh &amp; green Indore, civic body takes the e-way","This story is from January 21, 2020

Indore: Indore Municipal Corporation’s (IMC) sanitation inspectors will soon be seen making rounds in their wards on eco-friendly battery-operated scooters.

After providing e-cars to its assistant engineer and junior engineer-level employees, the civic body now plans to give e-bikes to sanitation inspectors of all 85 wards to reduce fuel cost.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said that these e-scooters will be bought with help of a private bank that has agreed to fund this project under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) work.

“Providing e-scooters to sanitation inspectors will strengthen our monitoring work on ground, and also help in reducing fuel and vehicle maintenance cost incurred by the corporation, especially during Swachh Survekshan,” Singh told TOI.

The commissioner said that these scooters are expected to cover a distance of at least 65km on single charge, and it would take around four hours to re-charge.

“Our sanitation inspectors will have to move on fields for monitoring purpose, and they are given at least 15-20 litre fuel every month. And giving them e-scooters would not only save fuel expense borne by IMC, but also encourage them to work more efficiently,” he pointed.

Singh said that they also have plans to equip these e-scooters with global positioning system (GPS) which would allow the corporation to track their movement on real-time basis. “This would also promote eco-friendly mode of transport in city,” he added.

The announcement comes nearly four months after Bhopal Municipal Corporation introduced a fleet of 200 electric scooters to monitor its solid waste management operations across the state capital.

The BMC had also proposed to set up solar powered charging stations across city to provide easy charging options for its health inspectors.

Badals with Amit Shah

JALANDHAR: Even as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is claiming that severing of ties with BJP in Delhi elections is only due to its “principled stand” on CAA, sources claimed that the saffron party has taken a calculated risk. Since SAD is facing challenge from within the ‘panthic’ fold, BJP has decided to engage with Sikhs directly in Delhi.

The break up may not have any immediate impact on Punjab as the assembly elections here are still two years away. In addition, their dependence here on each other is more crucial due to voters bases of Sikh and Hindus, to counter the Congress. Both parties were already back to normal within weeks of all the bitterness witnessed in Haryana durign the state assembly polls there in October.

Even on Saturday, when Delhi unit leaders of the Akali Dal, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Harmeet Singh Kalka, announced that they would not be contesting the state elections, they did not say anything about BJP.

Panthic turf, the core constituency of the Akali Dal, which gave it leverage to negotiate with BJP or with whichever party it joined hands in the past decades, has been slippery for it since Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing in 2015. It was mainly due to Sikhs voters turning away from SAD that the party was relegated to third position in Punjab. This handle has slowly been turned by the rivals of the Akali Dal within ‘panthic’ turf, who are also close to BJP, to create serious doubts about the Badals ’ ability to catch Sikh voters in entirety.

Notably, rivals of Parkash Singh Badal family, led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, managed to bring quite a few splinter groups on one platform and held a show of strength in Delhi on Thursday. They gathered under the banner of Safar e Akali Lehar (Journey of Akali movement) and vowed to end Badals’ hegemony on Sikh affairs. The show in Delhi, in which SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal was flayed by all speakers, just before the state elections there gave BJP enough headroom to see the element of uncertainty.

During the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee election in 2017, Delhi unit of the Akali Dal did not use pictures of Badals on its publicity material.

Former Punjab BJP president Shwait Malik, who left the charge just three days back, had gone on record saying that they did not mind Akali Dal taking its own nuanced stand on CAA and it won’t impact their relations.

Till a couple of days back, SAD has been maintaining that it would contest in alliance with BJP and it was only on Saturday they claimed that issue of CAA was a bone of contention. Even Janta Dal (United), with which BJP has alliance in Delhi, has also been taking a position similar to Akali Dal on CAA and NRC.

MUMBAI: Along with introducing integrated textbooks for various subjects, Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research (Balbharti) has also planned to run a pilot to introduce mathematics and science concepts in a bilingual format for vernacular medium students.

For the next academic year, Balbharti plans to print the English equivalent for various concepts in mathematics and environmental science in Marathi textbooks for classes I to V in six divisions of the state board—Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik and Aurangabad. Palghar is the selected district for Mumbai division. The idea was discussed at a recent meeting of officials from the bureau and the new school education minister, Varsha Gaikwad.

“Students studying mathematics and science in Marathi often have to use English terms in their day-to-day working. For instance, in science, we use terms like table, water cycle, rotation, distance etc and in mathematics we use angle, addition, minus etc. These subjects are taught in English in the higher secondary and higher education levels. Reports, research and references in the subjects are also in English. Students are also not evaluated on the basis of what terms they use but how they can apply the concepts. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that there would be a gap in the theory and practical application of these subjects,” stated a letter on Balbharti website.

Like in integrated textbooks, the bureau has uploaded samples of a maths and EVS textbooks for review. Some teachers said the practice was used in the past for extremely technical terms. The sample has several spelling errors but officials said these would be corrected.

Teachers have appreciated the effort but with caution. “It is a very practical hurdle for students who move to junior college. But this must not be a step towards converting vernacular medium schools into the semi-English format,” said Vilas Parab, a teacher of Balmohan Vidyamandir (Marathi). Shailendra Kumbhar, principal, Shailendra Education Society, Dahisar, said, “The practice must not be done in excess but only for technical terms. The sample has translations of words like ladder, window and even book.”

479,['21/01/2020'],Parent denied custody must be allowed to talk to child daily: SC,"This story is from January 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: Holding it to be a part of human rights of a child to get love and affection of both parents who are estranged and locked in matrimonial dispute, the Supreme Court on Monday said the parent denied custody of the child should have the right to talk to him or her for 5-10 minutes every day.

A bench of Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose said most courts while granting custody to one spouse do not pass any orders granting visitation rights to the other spouse.

“A child, especially a child of tender years requires love, affection, protection of both parents... Just because the parents are at war with each other, does not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love or protection of any one of the two parents...,” the bench said.

The SC, while adjudicating the custody battle of a US-based NRI couple, said even if custody is given to one parent, the other parent must have sufficient visitation and contact rights. The court said it is only in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied contact with the child and courts must assign the reason.

“ Unless there are special circumstances to take a different view, the parent denied custody of the child should have the right to talk to his/her child for 5-10 minutes everyday,” the bench said.

The court passed the order on a plea filed by a wife challenging order of the Rajasthan HC which directed her to go back to US to subject herself to court proceedings there on custody of two-and-half year-old daughter. She had left the US with her child despite a US court directing her not to leave the country.

The bench agreed with the contention of husband’s lawyer Prabhjit Jauhar who said it was his wife who initiated proceedings in the US court and the case must be adjudicated by that court. In case she refuses to go, the court directed that she then has to hand over the child to her husband or in-laws before the Register General of HC on February 3.

“In case the child goes to USA with the husband or either of his parents, the husband shall ensure that the child talks to her mother through video calling facilities everyday,” the court said.

CHENNAI: Car and bike parking rates at Dr MGR Central (Chennai Central) railway station may be increased, sources in Southern Railway told TOI.

Railway officials initiated a discussion in this regard after Chennai Metro Rail Limited opened its parking facility at the station recently. CMRL charges Rs 10/hour for bikes and Rs 25/hour for four-wheelers, at least twice what Southern Railway charges for parking at the station. The normal car parking rate at Central is Rs 25 for the first two hours, Rs 35 for the next two and Rs 70 for the subsequent two. Bike parking charges are Rs 5 for the first four hours and Rs 10 for up to eight hours.

A slot at the premium car park facility available opposite the Moore Market Complex (MMC) suburban station costs Rs 50 per hour.

Senior officials in Chennai division took up the issue of increasing the rate after CMRL opened its facility last week. One of the proposals is to increase rates for those who park vehicles for a long time, say a week or more. However, nothing has been finalised, sources said.

Chennai divisional railway manager P Mahesh did not respond to a call seeking clarification.

Meanwhile, opinions are divided over the issue. Some officials feel that CMRL offers a covered parking space which would keep bikes and cars safe during rain or during summer.

The parking spots also have proper pavements.

Compared to this, the railway parking lot for bikes and cars is either open or covered with a flimsy tin roof. The security at these lots is also suspect while the lanes inside are not paved. “Those who can afford to pay a higher fee will surely prefer the metro parking,” said a senior official. This will eat into the railway’s revenue, the official said.

However, another section of officials feels that parking rates on railway properties need to be increased as otherwise metro commuters would park on railway property due to cheaper rates.

Sekhri had levelled corruption allegations against Bajwa.

Sekhri, also former cabinet minister, had on Sunday alleged during a press conference in Batala that Bajwa and his supporters had indulged in charging hefty commission for allotment of development works there.

Sources close to Bajwa said the rural development minister had asked his counsel to serve a criminal defamation notice upon Sekhri for levelling ‘baseless allegations’ against his own party colleague. Bajwa had said that anyone can verify the work done in Batala by him and he was ready for any probe.

Allegation and counter-allegations between senior Congress functionaries is not new in Gurdaspur district . On January 5 this year, Congress MLAs Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa (Qadian) and Balwinder Singh Laddi ( Sri Hargobindpur ), and Sekhri had held a press conference alleging the minister was interfering in their constituencies.

AGRA: Mahatma Gandhi was never accorded the ‘Father of the Nation’ title by Government of India and no rule or ordinance was ever passed in this regard. This was stated by the Union cultural ministry in a response to an RTI query filed by Hathras resident Gaurav Agarwal.

Earlier in 2012, a student of class VI in Lucknow, Aishwarya Parashar, had filed an RTI in this regard and had written to then President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to issue a notification declaring Mahatma Gandhi the 'Father of the Nation'.

The home ministry had then told her that no action was taken on her plea because Article 18 (1) of the Constitution does not permit any titles except education and military ones.

Talking to TOI, Hathras resident Agarwal said that the purpose of asking this question was to “get clarity as everyone calls Mahatma Gandhi the Father of the Nation”.

Recently, a bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, had observed, “Mahatma Gandhi is the Father of the Nation and people hold him in high esteem, beyond any formal recognition”, while refusing to entertain a PIL seeking conferment of ‘ Bharat Ratna ’ on Mahatma Gandhi.

Anil Dutt Sharma, in his PIL, had sought a direction to the government to give “official decoration” to Mahatma Gandhi to honour him for his contribution to the nation.

The newly built apartments on the premises of the city police commissionorate

AURANGABAD: The families of serving police personnel, who had moved into the newly constructed flats on the premises of the city police commissionorate, have been facing erratic water supply.

Now, many families are unwilling to continue living on the premises as they do not get regular water supply . They are forced to buy drinking water on a daily basis.

The city police had built smart houses for the staff in multi-storey buildings. There are 10 apartment buildings on the premises and each of these buildings has 28 2BHK flats. The process of allotting the flats was initiated in September 2019.

The storage capacity of the water tank is 5.60 lakh litre and as per the calculation of 1,000 litre/family, the water released by civic body is sufficient for only one day. Currently, there are about 500 families including those of constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors, police sub-inspectors and assistant police inspectors residing in these apartments.

Residents said the water supply was normal for the first one month, but things changed drastically soon after. The civic officers ignored the pleas of the senior police officers. The families have been asked to use water judiciously and also store it.

A resident of the B wing said, “We get water only once in five days. It is difficult for us. People want the police to be on duty for 24 hours, but don’t we deserve regular water supply at least.”

She said that due to lack of water, they are struggling with their household work.

A policeman, who is lives in one of the flats, said that for the past several days, he had to go to office without taking a bath.

Residents unanimously said that they are being forced to purchase drinking water. “After getting stressed out on the field, we reach home only to face water woes,” said a head constable.

The women members of the families gathered for a recent haldi-kunku event organised by the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Meena Makwana, and expressed their anger before the officer.

When contacted, DCP Makwana first tried hushing up the matter by terming it to be an internal matter. Later, she expressed her helplessness in being able to address the issue.

She told TOI, “After the water supply department engineers did not respond to our requests, the matter has been brought to the notice of the commissioner of police, who is personally following the matter up with the Aurangabad municipal commissioner.”

The officer said the water supply department authorities have asked to adjust the lines of rest of the city, which too, on an average, gets water once in five days.

An officer privy to the issue said that senior police officers including DCP headquarters is upset as the water supply engineer, who is in charge of the area did not bother to answer her phone calls.
